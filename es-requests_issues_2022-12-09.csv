"MF ""prlr"" data changed","'@cprodhomme  @pabretonniere 

I am using Load function from S2dverification to load data for 4 experiments, one of them is MF whose data has changed. When I create the correlation map they are not the same as before. 

 MF data is loaded from the following folder:       /esnas/exp/EUROSIP/meteofrance/system4_m1/monthly_meanprlr_f6h/

We need to compare the last plots of the first two figures with the third figure. 
i.e. Compare 1-8 with 3-1 (MF -Winter prlr)
&   Compare 2-8 with 3-2 (MF-Summer prlr)

New sea ice concentration from ESA,"Hi @pabretonniere and @jginer 

Please download new ESA sea ice concentration data to /esnas/obs/esa described below:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sea Ice Climate Change Initiative team is pleased to announce the release of a full reprocessing of the Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) v2.0 Essential Climate Variable (ECV). The release provides Climate Data Record (CDR) of SIC over the polar regions, derived from medium resolution passive microwave satellite data of AMSR-E (June 2002 - September 2011) and AMSR2 (July 2012 - December 2015).

Two new CDRs are made available:

    The 25km SIC CDR based on 18.7 GHz and 36.5 GHz imaging channels (http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/c61bfe88-873b-44d8-9b0e-6a0ee884ad95);

    The 50km SIC CDR based on 6.9 GHz and 36.5 GHz imaging channels (http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/70f611b0-ba82-48e6-9190-a62cf9f925f2).


Please visit the respective landing pages for access to  documentation and data.


Alternatively you could access the documentation and data via the Integrated Climate Data Center (ICDC: http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/projekte/esa-cci-sea-ice-ecv0.html).

The two SIC CDRs use different imaging channels and therefore they have different characteristics and accuracies. Initial validation work indicates that the 50km CDR has higher accuracy than the 25km CDR across the range of sea ice concentration values, however, it has lower spatial resolution. Compared to similar SIC CDRs available e.g. from EUMETSAT OSI SAF or NSIDC, the SICCI 25km CDR has finer spatial details, especially in the ice edge region due to the finer spatial resolution of the AMSR-E and AMSR2 data used here.

These two CDRs were generated in the context of the ESA Climate Change Initiative Programme (ESA CCI) by the Sea_Ice_CCI project (www.esa-seaice-cci.org). The EUMETSAT OSI SAF contributed with access and re-use of part of its processing software and facilities.

I think the files

retrieve missing start-dates in some NMME forecast systems,"Hello @pabretonniere , @jginer !

Of special interest are those from the NMME Phase2 (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/ctb/nmme/NMME-PhaseII-DataPlan-27May.pdf). And in particular, there seems that 2011 is lacking some start-dates. DPETNA would need 20110201 for SST (tos), and probably later precipitation (prlr); although you might want to retrieve the other start-dates from 2011 as well. The target systems lacking 20110201 are CanCM3, CanCm4, NCEP-CFSv2.

has a directory for original files, but doesn't have one for montly_means, which could be loaded directly with R.

Would it be possible to create it for tos and the new psl data?

here the list of our  needs for plotting, as discussed in our meeting

The data to test can be taken from: /esarchive/exp/ecearth/a0dw/

This is an coupled PISCES+NEMO exp, therefore both the physical and biogeochemical variables are presents in this exp.

The variables as example to be plotted should be: thetao which is in  a0dw_1m_19900101_19900331_grid_T.nc  and PO4 which is in a0dw_1m_19900101_19900331_PISC_T.nc

Please note that these files are three months long, but this length can change.
 
As starting we would like to have:

-Global map at surface and at 500 mt (averaged over a period and at one precise time)

-Time series (globally averaged and for basins or specific coordinates)

-Latitude/Longitude VS time 

-vertical section 

-total mass for PO4

-Depth integration for P04


Please, @fbeninca, @pabretonniere   let us know how we can help and facilitate your work, and if possible give us a timeline.


@rbernard, please add items or modify this list as you think it should be modified.

Wind module formatting,"Hi @jginer,

/esnas/exp/ecmwf/monthly_ensforhc/6hourly/uas

/esnas/exp/ecmwf/monthly_ensforhc/6hourly/vas

/esnas/exp/ecmwf/monthly_ensforhc/6hourly/uas/20160128

and convert the 20 yearly files inside each folder (1996 to 2015) into daily u and v averaging the four 6-hourly time steps. Then, you just convert the daily u and v in daily wind speed module with the usual formula: sfcWind = sqrt[u2 + v2]

Finally, you need to average the daily sfcWind in weekly sfcWind and store results in a new subfolder of: /esnas/exp/ecmwf/monthly_ensforhc/weekly_mean

ERA-Interim sfcWind and psl semi-operational,"Hi @pabretonniere,

this year we've prepared a new product for EDPR which focuses on wind speed variability in United States instead of Europe. It is based on the same wind speed and SLP data of JRA-55 already downloaded and formatted automatically by Julia in the operational system, so no new dataset or variable needs to be included in the operational service.

However, we'll also provide another product to EDPR based on sfcWind and SLP data from ERA-Interim, even if the 3-months delay will not allow us to generate it in an operational context. We plan to provide this second product only after ERA-Interim data is available, so all we need is to download 6-hourly sfcWind and SLP data of ERA-Interim and format it to daily values automatically, when it is available. Once it is formatted, we can link these data to the workflow already created by Julia which create the product for EDPR.

In summary, all we need is a Cron with Ecflow which from time to time check if there is new ERA-Interim data available to download and format. You might want to add it to Julia's Cron, to simplify your organisation (She download the data in bscearth000 and format it with another Cron in our fat nodes).

We plan to employ such a semi-operational system until the release of ERA5 data (from 1979 to present) in an operational framework (planned in May-August 2018). When it is available, we'll abandon both JRA-55 and ERA-Interim dataset and produce all reports for EDPR with ERA5.

UERRA European reanalysis,"Hi @pabretonniere,

A new set of reanalysis is available (since January, 1st 2018) for Europe from 1955 at 5km resolution (amazing!)

https://climate.copernicus.eu/sites/default/files/repository/Events/ICR5/Posters/01_S1_Bazile.pdf

This dataset can be downloaded at ECMWF, on the web platform (http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/uerra/levtype=sfc/stream=oper/type=an/), or from the Mars repository.

In my case I would need daily data of 2m temperature, precipitation, wind (x,y), sea level pressure and Z500.

If it is too much data, we could download only t2m and precipitation.

Would you have time to download them? I think it is of interest not only for me but also for many other people in the department.

Git project for stations lists,"'@fbeninca , @lcifuent and @mtpay have met today in this regards. Here are our conclusions:

We have identified the necessity of creating a git project with the station list and the metadata associated with each station in EIONET and EBAS. These station lists are updated with high frequency because new stations are active and a user may want to report a problem with the metadata (e.g. an error in the lat/lon precision that generates some km of difference)

The advantage of having a unified stations list with version control is that the different projects will use the same and more updated list. The projects that uses this list are:

- Download/formating of near real time and validaded data.
- Evaluation tool
- Database for CALIOPE evaluation in the website.

Actions:

1.  @fbeninca will create the first unified station list taking into account @lcifuent database and the new station identified by @kserrade 
2. @fbeninca will create the git project ""stations lists"" including the lists for EIONET and EBAS 
3. The updated and unified list of stations will be located in /esarchive/obs/eea/eionet/docs
4. @fbeninca will create the protocol about how to update the station list. At this point only two cases are taking into account:
*  When new stations appear.
*  When the user identified problems with the metadata.

Please let us know if you do not agree with something.

QA4ECV NO2 ECV precursor record (version 1.1),"Petition to download and formatting QA4ECV NO2 ECV precursor record.

The European QA4ECV consortium, consisting of KNMI, the University of Bremen, IASB-BIRA, Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and Wageningen University, announces the public release of a full data set of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns from the GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI, and GOME-2(A) sensors.

The QA4ECV NO2 Essential Climate Variable precursor product contains harmonized vertical NO2 columns for the period 1995-2017. The dataset contains three products: (1) the tropospheric vertical column density, (2) the stratospheric vertical column density, and (3) the total vertical column density. The NO2 ECV precursor data is available as Level 2 (orbital swath) data. In addition to vertical NO2 columns, the product contains intermediate results, such as the result of the spectral fit, fitting diagnostics, the averaging kernel, cloud information, and detailed algorithm and product uncertainty estimates.
Also Level 3 (monthly mean) data products are made available, based on Level-2 data of good quality, binned and averaged on a 0.125° × 0.125° degree global grid.

The NO2 data set can be found via the QA4ECV project website: 

www.qa4ecv.eu then click ECV DATA, or directlv via www.qa4ecv.eu/ecv/no2-pre. 

That page also provides additional information on these data, including the Product Specification Document, an interactive algorithm Traceability Chain, and a User Forum.

The QA4ECV datasets are linked to a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to enable direct referencing of the dataset, e.g. when using the dataset in a publication. The dataset format is netcdf.

ERA-Interim semi-operational,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso,

in the past you already automatized the updating process of downloading and formatting most of the variables of ERA-Interim reanalysis like psl and sfcWind as soon as data was released, usually 2-3 months after the current one in the case of ERA-Interim.

Now we need to include in this process all the six variables we're going to use in ESS in the next years: sfcWind, psl, tas, tasmax, tasmin and prls. All variables need to be formatted to daily and monthly means, except sfcWind which is also needed at 6-hourly time scale.

Checking /esnas/recon/ecmwf/erainterim, only two variables of this list at present are not yet updated automatically. They are:

- daily and monthly mean of tasmin

Daily and monthly means for sfcWind from several reanalyses until 201712,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso ,

Within the S2S4E project, we need to compare wind speed data from several reanalyses. All of them (except for the R2 (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis) are already in /esarchive/recon/, but the period finishing at the end 2017 is not covered (**I want to cover the period 1980-2017, when data are available**). In addition, some daily or monthly means are missing as well as wind speeds at 50m and 100m for MERRA2 and ERA5, respectively. Below I list what is missing for each reanalysis:

**ERA-20C**: 
* [x]    Compute daily means and monthly means for sfcWind 
* [x]    Download and compute daily and monthly means for windagl100

**ERA-5**:
* [x]    Compute daily means for windagl100 and expand sfcWind and windagl100 until 201712
* [x]    Expand monthly means of windagl100 and sfcWind until 201712
* [x]    Download and format other variables of interest (1 hourly): tmax, tmin, slp, z500, tdps

**MERRA-2**:
* [x]    Expand daily means of sfcWind until 2017 and add windagl50
* [x]    Expand monthly means of sfcWind_f1h and wind50m_f1h until 201712

**R1 (NCEP/NCAR reanalysis)**:
* [x]  Expand monthly means for sfcWind until 201712 (monthly means are in /esarchive/recon/ncar/r1)
* **NOTE**: I am aware you have noticed that data from this reanalysis are in two different paths: '/esarchive/recon/ncar/r1' and '/esarchive/recon/noaa/ncep-reanalysis'. How is going the merging?

**R2 (NCEP/NCAR reanalysis version 2)**:
* [x]  This reanalysis has to be downloaded (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds091.0/#!description), but it is not a priority yet. We need sfcWind in daily and monthly means covering the mentioned period. Please, put this download at the end of your TO-DO list.

MERRA-2 aerosol products,"Hi @msamso, 

I am writing you for asking again your help. I will need products from the MERRA-2 aerosol reanalysis database which are accessible here: https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/M2T1NXAER_V5.12.4/summary?keywords=%22MERRA-2%22. 

As you will see, the aforementioned data are reported for the whole world and on an hourly basis. Therefore, their size is relatively big (approximately 500mb). This means that the downloading will take time and we have to consider also the space in the storage system.

From all the variables included in the netcdf4 files the most important for my analysis are the following:

1. ""BCEXTTAU""  ==> ""Black Carbon Extinction AOT [550 nm]""
2. ""DUEXTTAU""  ==> ""Dust Extinction AOT [550 nm]""
3. ""lat""       ==> ""latitude""
4. ""lon""       ==> ""longitude""
5. ""OCEXTTAU""  ==> ""Organic Carbon Extinction AOT [550 nm] __ENSEMBLE__""
6. ""SSEXTTAU""  ==> ""Sea Salt Extinction AOT [550 nm]""
7. ""SUEXTTAU""  ==> ""SO4 Extinction AOT [550 nm] __ENSEMBLE__""
8. ""time""      ==> ""time""
9. ""TOTEXTTAU"" ==> ""Total Aerosol Extinction AOT [550 nm]""

I would like to ask if it is feasible to download only the variables listed above instead of the whole file but keeping the structure of the raw files (e.g. netcdf4).

As an example, we can download the netcdf files only for 2015. Then, we can expand to the full study period (2007-2016).

Please let me know if something is unclear.

Many thanks in advance!

CMIP5 piControl variables,"Hello @msamso and @pabretonniere,

within the INADEC project I plan to analysis CMIP5 and CMIP6 piControl simulations. In particular, I would like to look at the variability of the sea surface temperature over the North Atlantic region, and to understand its causes.

To do so, I would need the following data (importance going from crucial (1) to optional (5)):

(**1**)
* monthly tos 
* monthly tas

(**2**)
* monthly hfls
* monthly hfss
* monthly mlotst
* monthly psl
* annual msftzmatl or msftmyz
* annual so
* annual uo
* annual vo
* annual thetao

(**3**)
* monthly pr
* monthly rlds
* monthly rlus
* monthly rsds
* monthly rsus
* monthly siconc
* monthly sithick
* monthly wfo

(**4**)
* monthly zg500
* monthly tauuo
* monthly tauvo

(**5**)
* monthly uas
* monthly vas


Some comments:

1) On `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5/piControl/original_files`, I saw that monthly `hfls`, `hfss`, `rlds`, `rsds` are already here but not formatted as in the other CMIP5 directories (see for example the historical directory). Do you mind to format them as it is for the historical simulations, please?

2) I understand that I am asking for lots of data. Approximatively, this would represent 1T. Please, let me know how much you consider this as an issue.

3) Annual average may not exit on the CMIP database. In that case, and as I really don't need 3D oceanic monthly variables, I would propose to temporarily download the 3D monthly oceanic files and to compute the annual mean before to erase the monthly data (I can do that).

4) CMIP6 data are still not produced / available and they probably won't be available before 2019. But, I would like to start working on my project before that. Do you think it will be possible to download the CMIP5 data by October? Here is the list of the CMIP5 model:

ECMWF System 5 Data,"Hi @ngonzal2 and @pabretonniere 

I have quite a lot of ECWMF System 5 data, 6 hourly and 12 hourly, on a Server in Birmingham. Around 11TB.

I saw that in `/esarchive/exp/EUROSIP/ecmwf/system5_m1/6hourly` there is already some 6 hourly data but at least `psl` and `sfcWIND` are quite incomplete. I could offer to transfer the data from Birmingham (or parts of it) if needed. That would certainly be a lot faster than getting them from the ECMWF Mars Archive.

Formatting CAMS50 regional data,"This issue is to inform and document the formatting of CAMS50 regional data for the ensemble forecast.

The CAMS50 regional data for 2016 has been formatted according to the convention. You can find the dataset here: ```/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/cams50/eu/hourly/```

The pollutants post-processed are O3, NO2, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5

For the formatting, I used the MONARCH_Reduce (https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/AC_Reduce/commit/aea1c5fe69430b44dccda05315552136ff84410d). I've also uploaded the script with some modification in the ```/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/cams50/scripts/MONARCH_Reduce/launch_cams50_reduce.sh```

You will download a zipped file (~2.8 Gb) which results in a huge unzipped file (~25 Gb).

*  In `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5/decadal/mpi-esm-lr/cmip5-decadal_i1p1/monthly_mean/psl` the year 1961 is missing
*  In `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5/decadal/miroc5/cmip5-decadal_i1p1/monthly_mean/tas` there is a README saying that the data are from assimiliation runs? Is that really the case?
*  Is there are website where we can I could find out how many members each model has?
*  Is GFDL in `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5/decadal in the directory decadal` the same model as GFDL-CM3 in `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5/historical`?
*  There is no geos5 in `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5/historical` or historical experiment in `/esarchive/exp/geos5`. Does that maybe have another name or is it missing? If so, I will open another issue for that one. 

Sorry to ask, and I certainly don't want to rush anyone but I have no experience in how long such a download usually takes. So, any rough guesses when this will be downloaded?

Multi - model analysis
A ftp server has now been set up at the Nansen Center, to gather the model data to be 
analysed:
ftp://ftp.nersc.no/BlueActionWP4
Username: sst_propagation
Password: 8M4-SZUhxF5d&gQ!
I’ve started the analysis with the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model. This includes 20 ensemble members, initialized by assimilation of SST. We have focused on the time period 1960 - 2010.
Assimilation ends at the end of November, so the first start date for the hindcast is 1st of  December 1959. The following ensemble hindcasts start every second year and are 10 - year long.
It would be very much appreciated if the model data could be given in the following format:
–
netCDF files with the 2D field of ensemble mean SST for the winter season (Jan - Apr)  or each  year, on the original grid.

longitude and latitude of the ocean model grid cells.
If possible, the 2D SST fields for each hindcast could be put together in one file,  or instance in  this way: norcpm_sst_month1-4_hindcast1960_1969.nc, with dimensions: 
sst(x,y,time), in the case of NorCPM this would be x=320, y=384, time=10

Please let me know if something is unclear or if you have any question.
It would be very good if you would indicate a contact person for the model data. And also, if you/contact person would be happy to contribute to the study through discussions and interpretations of the model intercomparison.

EC-Earth decadal sea-ice concentration,"Hi,

I've been working on tas, prlr and psl decadal forecast quality assessment using EC-Earth2.3, and now I would like to extend the assessment to sea ice concentration (ileadfra or sic depending on the experiments).
I used decadal data from experiments i00k, b037, i01j, a091, a098, a0ha and a0w8 of EC-Earth. Here are 3 questions related to this:
- For the i00k and b037 experiments, there is a directory called ""ice"" with info on the sea ice concentration in the ice_*.nc files under the ileadfra variable. Is that the right place to look for sea ice concentration?
- For the other experiments (starting with a091), for the other variables there was a 5-year nectdf file available (for example for tas in a091: /esarchive/exp/ecearth/a091/monthly_mean/tas_f6h/tas_20141101_fc0-4_201411_201910.nc), but these files haven't been created for sic. Would it be possible to create and include them please?
- Also, there is no sic data available for the 2017 forecast a0w8. Why is that?

bgc-argo data download and processing,"Hi @pabretonniere,

@mfalls and I @mgalitap are working to develop a processing pipeline for bgc-argo data. The whole idea is described in a file that I will share via google Drive. First steps involve (quoting the document): 

""3. How would I like to organize the data?

The current data format (variables in separate 2D matrices) is not convenient for our analysis. A data structure resembling a 3D matrix would probably better fit our needs. I propose the following steps:

3.1 Putting all the data in a single 2D matrix or anh other convenient format (note that the 11 first columns are common). Since not all variables are available in all profiles, we need to match the different 2D matrices according to float number, profile cycle, date, and depth (in this order).

3.2 Linearly interpolating (or binning by averaging) all profiles onto a common depth grid with slightly coarser resolution. This should make easier the storage of different profiles in a “3D structure” or an analogous array form. The common depth grid could be something like 2 m intervals between 0 and 350 m and 10 m intervals down to 1000 m.

3.3 For each float, storing the data in a 3D matrix with dimensions x = variable, y = time, z = depth. Store as netcdf.

3.4 For each float, make simple plots for a preliminary check of the data (to be defined. Example: depth-time heatmaps for each z variable).""

We would like to know if there is any python packages already available that perform this task (or something similar) so that we do not have to develop from scratch.

naming of CMIP5 decadal and historical data,"'@msamso @pabretonniere @dverfail 

CMIP5 data on /esarchive is always labelled i""I""p""P"" . In theory these numbers correspond to something. All (at least CMIP5) historical, non-initialised simulations should have I=0, e.g. i0p1. 

Have a look here on page 5:
https://cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/docs/cmip5_data_reference_syntax.pdf

According to @lcaron, for the CMIP5 decadal simulations, the ""I"" corresponds to a initialisation type (e.g. full-field or anomaly). That's possibly the reason why `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5/decadal/hadcm3` starts with `i2p1`.

I'd suggest to keep the naming of other decadal simulations (not CMIP5) accordingly and if unsure document it in a README or somehow. I would like to avoid that we assume some decadal simulation was produced with a certain initialisation type but actually wasn't.

Clean up recent tests, failed experiments, or experiments that were discarded. In particular:
* [x]  test performed with the VHR configuration @tarsouze 
* [x]  test performed for the EnKF, in particular at high resolution @jacosta 
* [x]  tuning runs @rfernand @emoreno 

Since HighResMIP (PRIMAVERA simulations) are available on JASMIN, we will retain only the data that we will be looking at, not the entire set that was produced. If you want to keep some of these data, make a list and send it to @lcaron 

* [x]  @yruprich to further reduce the amount of data produced by his AMV experiments

ERA-Interim tasmin  weekly means,"Hello @msamso, 

I need the weekly means of T mins. The days averaged should be the same as in other weekly files:  days 5-11, 12-18, 19-25, 26-32 from the startdate. This variable has to be done differently to the averaging of other variables, can you process them in 2 different ways:

1) Weekly mean of the daily minimums. First obtain the daily T min (this may exist already from ERA-I according to @pabretonniere - but we could not find it. there were these files /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/erainterim/original_files/fc_ei_sfc_oper_ecmf/tasmin-tasmax_2012.grb which contained timesteps ). Then average over 7 days.

this will be stored as  
/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/erainterim/weekly_mean/tasmin_f24h

 
2) If possible, compute the absolute min T over a week period (if T min exists from ERA-I in 6 hourly frequency)
this would be stored as: 
 /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/erainterim/weekly_**min**/tasmin_f6h   (or whatever frequency it is derived from)

wrong HadCRU 4.4 tas for year 2014,"hi @pabretonniere 

some of the files in `/esarchive/obs/ukmo/hadcrut_v4.4/monthly_mean/tas` for the year 2014 have wrong dates and most likely also wrong values. 

e.g. `ncdump -h tas_201401.nc` has this line 
```
cdo add ../tas_clim/tas_198001.nc tas_201401.nc
```
Other, supposedly correct files, show this line instead
```
cdo add tas_201408.nc clim08.nc /esnas/obs/ukmo/hadcrut4/monthly_mean/tas/tas_201408.nc
```

The date in the file is therefore also 1980 rather than 2014. 

I think there are a few more months in 2014 that show this issue.   

Thanks a lot!

Download CAMS regional data for individual models,"Hi,

based on some recent requests on CAMS regional data (https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/issues/234 and https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/issues/479), the AC group would like to ask for the downloading and formatting of the CAMS regional forecast for individual models.

The request is based on this command:

There will be an issue about how storage the formatted data for individual models. For example, O3 concentration for the ```ensemble``` is stored is the folder ```/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/cams50/eu/hourly/sconco3``` . In case of O3 concentration from CHIMERE, how should we store this? 

@pabretonniere do you think it makes sense to create a folder like this: ```/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/cams50_chimere/eu/hourly/sconco3```. In this case, we should download the data in a folder like this: ```/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/cams50_chimere/original_files```

download TROPOMI products,"Hi @pabretonniere (cc @cperez @ojorba )

As I just told you, we are planning to start playing a bit with the TROPOMI satellite observations in 2019. So it would be nice to set the downloading process.

To download TROPOMI data, you have to use the dhusget.sh script originally downloaded in the User Guide section of the Copernicus Data Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/userguide/BatchScripting). I modified it by adding a flag ""-M <processing mode>"" with two possible values for <processing mode> : NRTI (near-real time products) or OFFL (offline products). You can trace my changes by searching for ""herve"" in the script. 

You can find both scripts there :
```bash
/esarchive/scratch/hpetetin/tropomi/dhusget.sh #(modified)
/esarchive/scratch/hpetetin/tropomi/dhusget_original_20181129.sh #(original)
```

You will find an example of command in the top of the script (that will download 3 NRTI files of NO2 columns over a geographic region corresponding to coastal California during the recent fires of November):
```bash
./dhusget.sh -d https://s5phub.copernicus.eu/dhus -u s5pguest -p s5pguest -M NRTI -c -125.000,30.000:-115.000,40.000 -m Sentinel-5 -S 2018-11-05T19:00:00.000Z -E 2018-11-05T23:00:00.000Z -T L2__NO2___ -o product 
```
When you launch it, it will create various files/directories in the local directory and will save netcdf files there. 

So far, the TROPOMI data are released on a specific pre-operational Copernicus server (https://s5phub.copernicus.eu/dhus, i.e. not on the main Copernicus server https://scihub.copernicus.eu/ where are released the satellite products from the other space missions) on which everyone can access with the username/password s5pguest/s5pguest (but you don't have to care about that, it is already provided in the example command of my script).

Some available product are :
* L2__CO____ (only OFFL)
* L2__NO2___ (only NRTI)
* L2__O3____ (both NRTI and OFFL)
* L2__SO2___ (only NRTI)
* L2_AER_AI_ (only OFFL)

From what I saw, individual NRTI netcdf are roughly 20-40MB, OFFL netcdf are 100-300 MB.

Maybe you can download a few days to test on your side, for instance 01-05 november 2018 for several pollutant/processing mode.

I would like to do a test to see how quickly we can get the C3S data once they are out, i.e. I would like to have idea of the amount of time between the data is released by the C3S and the moment it is in our database. The idea behind this is to see whether we could use these data to make an actual forecast of tropical cyclone activity. This will depend on how quickly these data are made available to us here.

As a test, would it be possible to download the following variables: tos, ua200 and uas from System5 for the forecast of December 1st, 2018, asap? Monthly means are ok for my purposes, but I think you usually download 3-hourly and then compute the monthly means. If that is the case, don't change your methodology for me.

Glosea5 members,"I create this (very long...) issue after the first meeting we had a few weeks ago and the one we cancelled last week to finalize our strategy about the monthly means of the Glosea5 members. Given the complexity of the problem, we can still discuss this ""live"" if needed.

We talked with the ECMWF support about this (not with the MetOffice because this data is hosted on the Climate Data Store and Mars and the means are done by the ECMWF and not the MetOffice).

The monthly means are released once a month (the 13th) taking a certain number of members from the 6 hourly data provided by the MetOffice. From last November there are 60 members. Between November 2018 and the beginning and the forecast (September 2017), there are 50 members. The hindcast has 28 members.

The mean is done taking the necessary members closest to the first of the month: 13 days until the 13th + the necessary number before the 1st of the month. According to the number of members (50 or 60) and the date, the number of days taken in the past can vary. In theory, there are 2 6hourly members run every day, but, as explained by the ECMWF: 
> ""Forecast failures on a given date are not usually recovered by re-running the missed forecasts at a later date, but by running more members with initial conditions of the day of recovery. Example: An incident affected the 22 August 2017 forecast so no members are available for that date. Instead, 4 members were initialised on 23 August 2017."" 

This means that the monthly mean of the 2 members initialized the 9th or the 11th of the month will only be a mean on part of the month, putting NaN in the dates from the 1st to 8th (or 10th).

Finally, quoting the ECMWF, 
> ""regarding the length of the monthly means dataset, it has been a matter of design. Even the daily/subdaily original data has longer forecasts, just the first 6 calendar months are currently in use for the C3S derived products, hence just 6 forecast months are available even for those systems where a 7th month could have been added."" 

In summary and to decide what we will do in esarchive:

*  download the 6hourly data with 2 members per day
*  process the monthly means from the 6hourly as explained above for the 6hourly data we have
*  download the monthly means operationnally directly as processed by the ECMWF


Note that we have a similar issue for the CFSv2 data from issues https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/issues/502 and https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/issues/303 from @amanriqu and @lcaron 

I guess that @amanriqu , to keep coherence between the system used in S2S4E (GloSea5/CFS), would prefer we do one start date per month with as many members as possible, as described above (option 1) whereas @lcaron seemed to be interested in doing the individual monthly mean from each start **day** even if they have less members (option 2). 
To be able to do both, one solution is to call files from option 1 ${var}_${startyear}${startmonth}.nc and files from option 2 ${var}_${startyear}${startmonth}${startday}.nc

era5 from CDS vs Mars,"Hi,

We noticed recently that there is a difference between the era5 data downloaded from  mars and from the CDS. We currently have in esarchive a mix of both. We will separate them. Also, the time coverage of the data is different on both servers (RA5 1979-1999 is only available via the Copernicus Climate Data Store https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).

I sent the message below to the ECMWF to ask for clarification.

```
Hello,        

In the past, we downloaded era5 1hourly data from mars. Now that the CDS is available, we decided to download the following years through the CDS.        

According to the documentation (https://confluence.ecmwf.int//display/CKB/ERA5+data+documentation) , ""ERA5 data available from the CDS has been pre-interpolated to a regular latitude/longitude grid appropriate for that data."".        

How is this interpolation done? I guess it is using MIR?        
We'd like to reproduce the behaviour of the CDS without having to download again all the data.   
On another hand, we received a few weeks ago an email saying that for seasonal forecast, the C3S data wouldn't be available any longer on Mars but only on the CDS. Will the same thing happen for era5? If yes, when?      

Last question, we understood that if we download hourly data from Mars with the stream oper and do the monthly mean, we should obtain the same thing as if we download the monthly data with the stream ""moda"". Can you confirm this is the case? (in our tests, it doesn't appear to be like this but we might be missing something).        

Thank you.`

We need to read directly from the pdf (there are many tables) but also we should discuss about the format, because this dataset will be considered a climatology, then, we need to revise the time variable.

At the moment, in the esarchive we have hourly data for the period 2013-2015. Currently, valid hourly EIONET data within the BSC storage are only available for 1000 over 4000 sites. Probably, only sites having hourly data have been considered (e.g. Italy has no data while having over 500 measuring sites reports daily PM10 data).

Then, (I think, @mtpay and @dbowdalo correct me if I am wrong) we are not considering those sites that are providing only daily data there are some sites that are providing only daily data.

mismatch in the date of daily data (SEAS5C3s forecasts vs. JRA55 reanalysis),"Hi @mariag @pabretonniere @rmarcos 
I have found mismatch in the time steps of daily data (SEAS5C3s forecasts vs. JRA55 reanalysis), which is important for comparing skill such as correlation. For every start date, the forecast starts 24 hour after the start date (ref time) in C3s . On the other hand, in JRA55, the first time step is 18 hours after the ref time.

I would like to have CMIP5 historical (1950-2005) daily mean surface temperature data (tas) and SSTs (tos) downloaded please. If it is easy to get tasmax and tasmin at the same time, that would be potentially useful for the future, but not necessary at this point. I would like as many of the CMIP5 models as is easy to get, with one ensemble member per model.

There is a SST pattern associated with heat waves that is present in Observations, and I want to see if it is present in any CMIP5 models. So it doesn't matter much which models I look at to start with, I just want to get an idea of whether this pattern is present in some of them. Though, the more models I have, the better.

* 3D: ta, ua, va, wap
* 2D: hfls, hfss, pr, ps, psl, rlus, rlut, rsds, rsdt, rsut, tos

You will see that for each models there are 2 different resolutions: **HR** and **LR/SR**.

And for each resolution 2 type of experiment exist: **primWP5-amv-pos** and **primWP5-amv-neg** (although MPI did not respect this name convention for there files, it should be called like that in our archive system).

Hence, to store those data, I guess we can create directories on esarchive called **${modelid}/primWP5-amv-pos** and **${modelid}/primWP5-amv-neg**?

---------------------------
---------------------------

For the simulations that are not on the DMT or ESGF yet, I am contacting the different centers and I will download the data myself and put them at the following place `/esarchive/scratch/yruprich/${modelid}`. Once all data are here for 1 model, could you then format them to be es-compliant?

I think in a first step we would need the **historical monthly** outputs for **tas**, **pr**, **tos** and **psl**. They seem to be available for different models, not only IPSL.
Later on, we can add other variables, frequency and experiments (for instance DCPP-A once they become available).

Thanks a lot!

new inidata needed to define dust mineralogy in MONARCH preprocess in MN4,"Hi,

In order to run simulations with dust mineralogy and monarch, we will need a couple of additional datasets in our common repository. 

I've already added them to the /esarchive/exp/monarch/static/geodata/, but @ojorba mentioned that I wouldn't have permissions to add them also to the common MN4 repo. Could anyone from CES assist me with this? @molid ?

They are currently stored in:

saving ERA surface forcings for EC-Earth OSM (Offline surface model),"Hi @pabretonniere the EC-Earth OSM  (Offline surface model) can be run with forcings from the ERA reanalyses (ERA20C, ERA-Interim, ERA5).

```
era20_yyyy.tar.gz for ERA-20C (160GB total)
forcing_ei_1_oper_3_yyyymm00.tar.gz for ERA-interim (139 GB total)
forcing_ea_1_oper_1_yyyymm.tar.gz for ERA5 (??? total)

I have downloaded the ERA-20C and ERA-interim (ERA5 in progress) at /esarchive/scratch/etourign/download/data/ecearth/osm/era

There are also post-processed netcdf files which are used by the OSM, and since they take less space than the originals (e.g. 37GB for era-interim) it would  be convenient to keep them as well.

Dear @pabretonniere, @msamso

We want to analyse salinity/temperature data from a particular ec-earth experiment ('cmip5-historical_i0p1') for the North Atlantic Ocean. We've noticed that the original ORCA files ('/esarchive/exp/ecearth/cmip5-historical_i0p1/original_files/ocean/ORCA1-SS41_MM_*_grid_T.nc.gz') have the salinity and temperature variables we need for this experiment, called 'vosaline' and 'votemper', respectively. They haven't been extracted yet to the monthly_mean folder
Could you please extract them?
We don't know if this is feasible at the same time, but could you also interpolate it onto a regular grid lon = 360, lat = 180?
We will eventually need density data, but the density part is not that urgent. Do you have a script to compute density for this experiment?

Urgent: cleaning of duplicated cmor.tar,"Hi @cp 


We are again getting very close to the limit of esarchive.

Special point from https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/issues/470#note_42653.

As I said, there are around 80TB of duplicated data. Many experiments, listed in /esarchive/scratch/pbretonn/monitor-esarchive/list-untarred-cmor.log have both CMOR.tar in /esarchive/exp/ecearth/$exp/original_files/cmorfiles and untarred cmor in /esarchive/exp/ecearth/cmorfiles. There are also some directories (especially in PRIMAVERA experiments) that were untarred in both /esarchive/exp/ecearth/$exp/original_files/cmorfiles and /esarchive/exp/ecearth/$exp/cmorfiles.

Unless you tell me the contrary, I will:
*  check if the content of /esarchive/exp/ecearth/$exp/original_files/cmorfiles/CMOR*tar is the same as the /esarchive/exp/ecearth/$exp/cmorfiles
*  if yes, erase /esarchive/exp/ecearth/$exp/original_files/cmorfiles/CMOR*tar

*Error in as.POSIXlt.character(x, tz, ...) : 
  character string is not in a standard unambiguous format
Calls: Start ... as.POSIXct.default -> as.POSIXct -> as.POSIXlt -> as.POSIXlt.character*

By looking a bit more deeply in the files that failed, I think I found the problem. This error only happens when the ""ensemble"" variable in the files is defined as ""int"". When it is defined as ""double"", the Start() call works well.

Could you please change the format of the ""ensemble"" variable from ""int "" to ""double"" in the following files?

NCEP cfsv2 extra dates: Jan-March  2011,"Hello @msamso and @lpalma, 

This is quite urgent as it is being used by @lpalma  for S2S4E subseasonal.  

Some of the missing dates of NCEP cfsv2 have been prepared for us in the same format as they were downloaded from noaa (issue #705 ).

There is tmax, tmin, tmp2m and wnd10m for January, February March 2011 with 6 hourly startdates (which were missing in the NOAA portal).
 
These will close the gap between hindast and forecast and will reduce considerably the missing data.

Cron gefs,"Hi,

We've revised with @fbeninca the different cronjobs downloading data and we've discovered that the directory /esarchive/recon/ncep/gefs contained 6TB of data downloaded everyday with some scripts written by Jordi Cuadrado (see below the details of time and scripts).


Is anybody using this data? If yes, we will add some email alerts in case something goes wrong. If not, we will stop the cron and eventually delete the data.

Thank you.

Sea Ice Concentration from the ESA CCI (v2.0 AMSR),"Hi @pabretonniere 

Is that possible to download the sea ice concentration from the ESA data product (v2.1 AMSR instrument) for the years 2016 and 2017? At 25km and 50km of resolution if possible. 

On /esarchive, the data only go up to 2015 (/esa/esa_v2.0-25km and 50km).

The data are available on these ftp: 
ftp://anon-ftp.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/esacci/sea_ice/data/sea_ice_concentration/L4/amsr/25km/v2.1
ftp://anon-ftp.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/esacci/sea_ice/data/sea_ice_concentration/L4/amsr/50km/v2.1

I will need them on monthly mean if it's ok.

Thank you.

CMIP6 data,"Hi @cp @bsolaraj 


As discussed with several of you, we are losing time and space reformatting to the ""esarchive format"" the CMIP6 data that we download from ESGF in cmor format.


Our department tools (startR, Earth diags,...) are anyway able to load CMOR format.

Hence the following proposal:

*  For every model (ecearth and others), the data will be downloaded in /esarchive/exp/$model/$exp/original_files/cmorfiles

*  We will create (or update) the symbolic links in /esarchive/exp/CMIP6/$cmor_exp/$model to point to /esarchive/exp/$model/$exp/original_files/cmorfiles (all members from the same ""cmor_experiment"" together)

* To facilitate the exploration of the data, we will also create a link called ""latest"" at the version level (last one in the CMOR tree) pointing to the version of the data as shown below

* For extra variables computed locally (such as sfcWind from uas and vas), we'll create them in CMOR-like format

Corrupted ecmwf system4,"Hi @llledo @vtorralba @jramon @cprodhomme @eexarchou @rwhite 


Unfortunately, some of the netcdf files of /esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system4_m1 were corrupted during the issue of the archive.
Even if the files hadn't been ""modified"" during the 23/07-05/08 period (the modification date that appears with ls -lrt is very old), some of them were temporarilly moved to /gpfs/projects to make space on esarchive and therefore can have been affected (you can see the real statistics of the files with the command stat $file).

The checker is currently running, I'll put here the full list of affected files (and reproduce them) but meanwhile, be aware that this directory (between many others...) can be affected by the corruption.

Please add to this issue anybody you know who might be using these files.

Clean and harmonise GFS-GEFS downloading data,"Aim: we are currently downloading a lot of GFS forecast data and mantaining a local archive. We need to reduce the types of GFS data we are downloading and clean the archive we have.

After a meeting with @pabretonniere @ctena @jescriba @ojorba, we agree in the following actions:

* All predictions based on GFS will use GFS forecast at 0.25 and we will stop downloading GFS at 0.5: currently CALIOPE uses GFS 0.25 at 12UTC, ICAP GFS 0.50 at 00UTC, DREAM GFS 0.50 at 00UTC, carbono runs GFS 0.50 at 00UTC. @molid and @ojorba need to coordinate to update ICAP forecast to use 0.25. @sbasart, do you think feaseable to make DREAM work with GFS 0.25?
* Revise the need of sst2dvar_grb_0.5.grib2 and rtgssthr_grb_0.083.grib2 and which systems use them (CALIOPE, ICAP, BDFC, DREAM?). @ojorba will revise that.
* Now there is an archive of old GFS forecasts at 0.5 at NOAA: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs. We will remove our archive of old GFS forecasts and will keep only one months of GFS 0.25 forecast downloaded everyday, and an archive of recent years of GFS (e.g., 2015-2019 at 0.5). @pabretonniere will check how we can download one year from that archive in an automatized way.
* We are also downloading GEFS analysis at 00, 06, 12, 18UTC at 0.5 everyday. There's an archive in https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-ensemble-forecast-system-gefs with the forecasts at 1deg. @jescriba and @ojorba will define what data we need to download everyday for operational assimilaton and the archive we want for research.

This is an ongoing issue, no downloading will be stopped until the forecasts systems are adapted to the new GFS 0.25deg data.",837,https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/837,Closed,ojorba,ojorba,Pierre-Antoine Bretonnière,pabretonniere,No,No,,2019-08-23 16:16:09,2020-08-17 17:18:00,2020-08-17 17:18:00,,,"Data,Working on it",0,0

and the link for `$experimentname$_f$originaltime$h` to the newest version of the dataset.

Problem in CMCC g500 original files,"Llorenç Lledó @llledo · 1 day ago

Also, there are several erroneous members in CMCC. For instance 201305 members 24 and 30 of are out of the typical range, at least for some lead times. Can you check the whole dataset please? I also found affected members in files for 1993, 1997 1999 and 2000, but I cannot build a complete list, because I didn't read all lead times of all start dates.

Hi,

The ECMWF files are now OK. What happened is that the original files had 2 levels together (10hPa and 500Pa) and that the formatting made the average of these 2 levels leading to unrealistic values. The range in which I checked the data was too loose and didn't detect this. C3PO will include the selection of the level in case the original files have several.

The units are also OK.

For CMCC I've reformatted and still get the same result. Yesterday night I put in queue the redownload of the original monthly and 12hourly data to see if the problem comes from the mean or from the real original data provided by CMCC. If the problem persists, I'll ask Eduardo in person if he has a clue...

Hi,

I've downloaded the 12hourly file and it has the same issue... About detecting it with min-max from DWD, this doesn't work, because at a global level, the ""bad timesteps"" are not especially wrong or out of the ranges, it's just a problem of continuity of the members between them. We could take an approach by region to detect the ""corrupted data"" but this will require further developments.

I've discussed with Eduardo and will send him an email to show him the issue. He will check if the problem can come from the transformation from netcdf to grib from the ingestion in MARS.

@jpena @jsala : this is an interesting use case for 512, I'll put the data and scripts in the 512 DQC gitlab so we can follow up with the investigation.

Note that this can't be seen in the 2 plots below but there are some timesteps that have ""blueish"" values in some regions that don't break any continuity so that's why we cannot detect this pattern in the global min/max analysis.

Hi,

I found a way to detect this automatically: comparing the global mean (by time step and member) of the problematic CMCC file with the global min and max of DWD (min and max over all timesteps, members, and period), we can see that the mean is out of the min/max for the 3 following timesteps/members. I'll update Edu. Meanwhile, as mentioned in the previous comment, I've moved the file somewhere else, but as I guess this won't be fixed soon, it might be worth removing (or interpolating?) these problematic timesteps.

Member 24, date 2013-06-01 has average 43894 which is out of the DWD global min/max (45612 - 58770)
Member 33, date 2013-07-01 has average 39139 which is out of the DWD global min/max (45612 - 58770)
Member 33, date 2013-09-01 has average 38806 which is out of the DWD global min/max (45612 - 58770)

Hi, I made a tentative list of problematic files, w the wrong lead times and members. I'm not 100% sure of having detected all wrong files. I made this by computing the mean over all grid points, and then for each start date and lead time subtract the median of all ensemble members. Then by plotting a histogram of these anomalies I selected -300 as a threshold of validity.

VISCA operational : multi-model,"Hi @pabretonniere, @lpalma, @fbeninca  and @msamso 

**By the end of this year**, @rmarcos and I need to include a multi-model based seasonal forecast product in the VISCA operational tool. For this purpose we need to combine seasonal forecasts from different C3S systems. Until now we have been working with ECMWF SEAS5, Météo-France System 6 and Glosea5-system 13. However MF system 6 and Glosea5-system 13 are not operational anymore. 

I've seen that ECMWF SEAS5 is regularly updated (as it is the system employed in the S2S4E DST), but we need the same for Météo-France System 7 and Glosea5-system 14. We need the operational forecasts and the hindcasts that will be available along with the forecasts. We only need monthly means for tas and prlr.

NCAR LENS tos issues continue ...,"Hi @msamso ,@pabretonniere ,

Once again the processed LENS data in monthly mean tos and tos-lonlat directories is corrupt, I think. I have compared these with raw data in (`/esarchive/exp/ncar/lens/original_files/monthly_ave/SST` , please see the plot. These results are for ensemble member 3, just to give you a clean picture, and of course other members are corrupt too. The anomaly is for 1961-2005 for first plot and 1961-1996 for the second plot. The green line from raw data makes sense while other two do not make any sense for 1961-2005 anomalies. I have attached the NCL scripts that were used to create these plots. I think the issue with this data has been dragging too long with one issue fixed while other popped in (previous issues with the same data were #804 , #896).

CAMS-84 CAMS Server:  Transfer AERONET directsun level15,"Hola @fbeninca,

Within CAMS-84 one of the tasks is to upload the observations that we are using for the validation reports to the CAMS Server. In our case, we are using AERONET and EIONET. But we will only have to deliver AERONET because other groups will take care of EIONET. After some iterations with Sander Niemeijer <sander.niemeijer@stcorp.nl>, who is responsible for this task, we have a final sample file that he approved. 

Main features:

*  **One file per site and day on 15minutely basis** that should be transferred every day to the CAMS server

*  For the filename: 

The format should follow `<archive>-<producttype>-<variant>-<location>-<timerange>-<version>-<generationdate>.nc` (where some items are potentially optional). In our case, the 'V3' could be used for 'version' and 'LEV15' as 'variant' element.'producttype is 'AOD' since there is apparently also an SDA AERONET product. So a potential example could be: `aeronet-aod-lvl15-barcelona-201909-003-20191004T123456.nc`

*  You will find the script and the resulting nc file that was approved in the following attacheds:

[aeronet-aod-lvl15-Barcelona-20190901-003-20191120T110400.nc](/uploads/40561f339317d0dd43c04d881f85f516/aeronet-aod-lvl15-Barcelona-20190901-003-20191120T110400.nc)

[esarchive2harp_15min.r](/uploads/c69f5fc11adf8c8c21f7a9d254f22b3f/esarchive2harp_15min.r)

Be aware that there are scalars instead dimensions and the data is filtered to be finite values.

Also, I am under discussions about the selection of AERONET sites. I would say that we have to have a script that will read a txt file with the list of sites to be processed, then, the selection is variable.

After the AERONET direct-sun deployment, we should also send them AERONET O'Neill. But this will in the future.

I am waiting for the details of the CAMS server.

I think that this is all.

Keep in touch

Download Lunar AOD (V3) provisional [AERONET],"Hi @msamso,

I need to download the SDA lunar AOD from AERONET Version 3 (Level 1.5). The aforementioned data are available here (https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/webtool_aod_v3_lunar). As you will see, the only way for downloading the data is through the selection Geographic Location-> Get Country of State -> Country/State -> Get AERONET Sites -> AERONET Site -> Get Download Form. 

Following the above mentioned steps you will result in a webpage as for example here: https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/webtool_aod_v3_lunar?stage=3&place_code=10&region=Europe&state=Germany&site=Leipzig&submit=Get+Download+Form

The whole process (quite boring!) for one station can be done without spending much time. However, I would like to download all the available stations through an automatic way. I am wondering if this is feasible. 

To be more specific, I need the SDA retrievals (L1.5; All points) which can be found by selecting the options shown in the attached image in the example webpage (https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/webtool_aod_v3_lunar?stage=3&place_code=10&region=Europe&state=Germany&site=Leipzig&submit=Get+Download+Form)

* [x]  Prlr
* [x] Rsds
* [x] Tas
* [x] Tasmin
* [x] Tasmax
* [x] Psl
* [x] sfcWind

All the past files have the MARS grid, so  I think it is important to maintain it. I have noticed that there are mixed grids in era5 for several variables, we will have to fix that.

**PRLR**
There are 2019 files in another dir prlr instead of prlr_s00-01h, but with different grid. So I guess we will have to download it again.

**TAS**
Same as prlr, the problem here is that the files are in the same dir 1hourly/tas 

**TASMIN**
There are no 2019 files formatted.

**TASMAX**
There are no 2019 files formatted.

**RSDS**
There are no 2019 files formatted. 

**PSL**
There are files for 2019 with the CDS grid.

**SfcWind**
There are files for 2019 with the CDS grid.

The idea of this issue is to clean the files with different grids and recollect the scripts that format these variables (I have the scripts downloading this data in MARS but maybe we can try auto-mars for the operational dl of ERA5 @pabretonniere ). 

Thanks,

Resolution and directory name - ERA5 1hourly and others,"Hi @pabretonniere and @lpalma,

For ERA5 1hourly there are more variables with lonlat resolution: g500 mhfls mhfss mrlds mrsds prlr psl , as you can see in the attached file: [lonlat.log](/uploads/73c2211f4f17c6195070ef76ce69b6e5/lonlat.log)

There are different resolutions for each system, like in the issue #1022 (CDS (lonlat), Mars(gaussian)), then it could be a good idea to change the name of the directories which don't have a gaussian resolution to `<var>-<non-gaussian-resolution>`, like for example psl-r1440x721. What do you think?

"ERA5 EDA sfcWind and windagl100 at hourly, daily and monthly resolutions","Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso ,

Within my PhD thesis, I will start looking at the uncertainty that comes from the observational reference and how this impacts the forecast verification. ERA5 ensemble members allow estimating this uncertainty so that I would need surface and 100-metre wind data, at hourly, daily and monthly resolutions. As usual, you can download these data from CDS (Product type: ensemble members and reanalysis). These are the variables ordered by priority:

 * [x] windagl100
 * [x] sfcWind

Please, take into account that the ERA5 EDA might be a new dataset different from ERA5 (HRES).

sfcWind daily means from 6-hourly data for MF system6 and glosea5-system13,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere ,

Tasmax / Tasmin monthly mean computation,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere , 

We have realised that in the 'monthly_mean' folders the computation of the tasmax / tasmin variables comes from the 'daily_mean' folder. This means that it is the average of the daily averages, being the daily mean computed according to the corresponding frequency (i.e. at tasmax_f1h means the daily average comes from the averaging of 24 hourly maximum values). 

For our work we also need the monthly averages of the daily maximum / minimum values (which would come from the 'daily' folder). @cchou and me have talked with @msamso and realised that in some cases this will imply two different tasmax / tasmin monthly means in the same 'monthly_mean' folder. 

Since this applies to all the exp / recon folders (except for the ones having f24h -if I'm not wrong in that case there is just one value per day, so it will be only the 'daily_mean' folder), it would be nice to come to a general solution (aside from the specific computation that we need for ERA5).

Thanks a lot,

Re-organize CAMS_GLOBAL pressure level downloading for MONARCH/CALIOPE,"We need to clean the way we download and use CAMS_GLOBAL pressure level files in both CALIOPE and MONARCH. The current situation is:

- Gas-phase data is archived in `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/cams_nrealtime/original_files/fc_mc_pl_oper_ecmf` in grib format for CALIOPE (years 2015 to 2020) and netcdf for MONARCH (only year 2016)

- Aerosol data is archived in `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/cams_nrealtime/original_files/fc_mc_pl_oper_ecmf/newvars/nc` in netcdf format for MONARCH (only year 2016)

There is an automatic downloading of gas-phase grib files of the 00UTC fcst used in CALIOPE that includes variables we don't use.

My proposal is to harmonise the downloading and create netcdf files with the format available in dissemination.ecmwf.int. As example, I've downloaded some sample files we should use to harmonize the downloading. The files and variables that we will need are:

```shell

Suspicious sfcWind data DWD System 2,"Hello @msamso and @pabretonniere ,

May I ask you to revise the scripts you used to generate the newest files in:

``/esarchive/exp/dwd/system2_m1/6hourly/sfcWind``

Although the data seem to be apparently correct, I've made some skill plots and they look as if the data were not correct (the data may not correspond to the period the files indicate). I've repeated the experiment many times, and revised my scripts as well, but can't find any explanation.

The older files ``/esarchive/exp/dwd/system2_m1/6hourly/sfcWind/*1101.nc`` were generated by @pabretonniere in May 2019, and these data I think are correct.

I can upload the skill plots if you need more info.

Unexpected result derived from System5-C3S daily precipitation data sets,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso ,

I hope you are doing well at home during this period.

For the project MED-GOLD, the System5-C3S daily precipitation forecast is used to derive an index (spring total rainfall, sprR) and then the RPSS (against ERA5) is computed for the period 1993-2019. 
Here, the forecasts for the start months from January to April are considered. 
Since the period of sprR ranges from 21 April to 21 June, it was expected to see an improving performance when the start month moves from January to April.
However, the performance for April is the worst (i.e., an obvious drop from March to April) among the four months mentioned, that I am trying to figure out the potential reasons.

Instead of looking at the performance values (i.e., RPSS), I tried to check the difference of the actual spring total rainfall between the forecasts and ERA5. When compared to the interannual average value of daily precipitation of sprR from ERA5, indeed, there are some days in which the median of forecasts for April is more away than March. In other words, the spring total rainfall amount for March is closer to ERA5 than April although the differences are small. 

Therefore, I am wondering whether it is possible to doublecheck if there are any potential issues with the processing of the raw forecast datasets, e.g., download, calculation, merging?
It might be good to start with the following files:

```
/esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily/prlr_s0-24h/prlr_19930401.nc
...
/esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily/prlr_s0-24h/prlr_20190401.nc
(the start month of April from 1993 to 2019)
```

After April, it will be great if start months from January to March could be checked as well.

Please let me know if you have any clue/hint/idea about what may cause this issue.
Thank you so much.

Difference between daily_mean/prlr and daily/prlr,"Hi @msamso,

As I have already commented to you, I have found the paths

```
esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily_mean/prlr_s0-24h
esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily/prlr_s0-24h
esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily/prlr
```
and I didn't understand the difference since the variable name is 'Total precipitation'.

similar paths are:

```
/esarchive/exp//cmcc/system3_m1-c3s/daily_mean/prlr_s0-24h  
/esarchive/exp//cmcc/system3_m1-c3s/daily/prlr_s0-24h
```

I guess that the files under daily_mean would have a different variable name such as 'Mean precipitation', right?


Thanks for your help!

Issue with sfcWind_f1h ERA5 data (201909),"Hi @pabretonniere , it seems like there is an issue with the ```sfcWind_201909.nc```file located in ```/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/daily_mean/sfcWind_f1h```. As you will see, the file has more time steps than the ones it is supposed to have (126 instead of 30). Also, the size of the file is larger than what it is supposed to be, when compared with the other months (which I guess it is because of the larger number of time steps included):

Could you check what is the issue?

Once you find the problem, could you also correct the reordered version of the file (i.e. the one we are using with HERMESv3)?

Issue with tas ERA5 data (daily_mean 2019),"'@pabretonniere , hi again,

I found another issue with the daily_mean files of tas from ERA5 (```/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/daily_mean/tas_f1h```).
I looks like that not all the files from 2019 have the same spatial resolution. Example:

````

I checked the last files you generated (year 2017), and there everything looks consistent. Example:

I do not know how ```lpalma```proceeded to generate the files for 2019, but I think there might be an issue.

I would need to use the HighResMIP data available from the simulation outputs in /esarchive/exp/ecearth/ to run diagnostics with ESMValTool. I was wondering if it would be possible to copy certain experiment dataset outputs to a common path such as the /esarchive/exp/CMIP6 or the /esarchive/exp/PRIMAVERA (I don't know which of the two would make more sense). I only need the 'tas' and 'pr' variables of the hist-1950 and highres-future experiments. The paths to the variable directories are the following:

If it is moved to /esarchive/exp/CMIP6, i guess a new directory should be created below that named /HighResMIP and then the datasets just after so that the path to the files follows the following structure:

/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/{exp}/{dataset.lower}/{project.lower}-{expid}/

If it is better to move it to /esarchive/exp/PRIMAVERA, then the path structure could be the following:

/esarchive/exp/PRIMAVERA/original_files/{institute}/{dataset}/{exp}/{ensemble}/{mip}/{short_name}/{grid}/{latestversion}/



------- data download -------

Additionally, It would be nice to have HighResMIP results from other institutes. The variables are 'pr' and 'tas' for the 'hist-1950' and 'highres-future'. As for the ensembles it would be great to have as many as possible, but if that is not an option at least download the r1i1p1f1. Here are the links:

ERA-5 CDS data update,"Hi @pabretonniere @msamso,

As I commented to Pierre-Antoine, before the webinar on 8th June I need ""real time"" reanalysis data from era5 to do spring cases of study. The details are the following ones (in priority order):

* [x] 1.1 tas monthly:
- Path /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/tas_f1h-r1440x721cds
- Variable: tas
- Period of time: 1993:(last available)

* [x] 1.2 tas daily: 
- Path /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/daily_mean/tas_f1h-r1440x721cds
- Variable: tas
- Period of time: 1993:(last available)
- Frequency: daily mean, f1h

* [x] 2.1 prlr monthly:
- Path /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/prlr_s0-24h-r1440x721cds 
- Variable: prlr
- Period of time: 1993:(last available)

* [x] 2.2 prlr daily:

- Variable: prlr
- Period of time: 1993:(last available)
- Frequency: daily mean, f1h

* [x] 3.1 sfcWind monthly:
- Path /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/sfcWind_f1h-r1440x721cds (it is not created yet, but looking at the other variables seems that it is the name it should have) 
- Variable: sfcWind
- Period of time: 1993:(last available)
- Frequency: monthly mean, f1h

* [x] 3.2 sfcWind daily:
- Path /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/daily_mean/sfcWind_f1h-r1440x721cds 
- Variable: sfcWind
- Period of time: 1993:(last available)
- Frequency: daily mean, f1h


* [x] 4.1 rsds monthly:
- Path /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/sfcWind_f1h-r1440x721cds (it is not created yet, but looking at the other variables seems that it is the name it should have) 
- Variable: sfcWind

- Period of time: 1993:(last available)
- Frequency: daily mean, f1h

As this type of data may be requested from now on every few months, It would be very useful to maintain it updated monthly.

All the best

Formatting APPLICATE stream 2 data,"Hi @pabretonniere,

The time has come to format and upload the stream 2 seasonal hindcasts to the data portal. 
There are three different experiments (a2p9, a2qg and a2vv), each one with 10 members per stardate that should be merged into a single experiment with 30 members. Alternatively, we can merge all 30 individual members into one file per variable per startdate, whatever is easier. The variables to be uploaded are all the variables from Amon, Omon, SImon and tas, psl and pr from day.

For example a2p9 data is here: 

`/esarchive/exp/ecearth/a2p9/original_files/cmorfiles/DCPP/EC-Earth-Consortium/EC-Earth3/dcppA-hindcast/`





I have set the outclass to DCPP in all experiments and there are a few things in the global attributes that might need modification, in addition to the ensemble member that goes from 1 to 10 in each experiment. 

The global attributes that I think need modification are the following:

` 

                :Conventions = ""CF-1.7 CMIP-6.2"" ; -> Only ""CF-1.7""  and if possible ""CF-1.7 ACDD""?

If we want the data to be ACDD compliant (not mandatory but highly recommended for some variables) we might need to add additional attributes described in this video here: https://applicate.met.no/)

JRA55 data format problem,"Hi @pabretonniere,

As @fbeninca has reported in [VISCA issue  # 12](https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/VISCA/issues/12), there is a error returned by Load when reading a file in Nord3.

The file for July 2018 returns the error, while avoiding this file everything works smooth.

Looking into the files there are some differences (e.g.: 'nbnds'), but I don't know if this follows the standards of esarchive:

```
ncdump -h /esarchive/recon/jma/jra55/monthly_mean/tas-640x320_f6h/tas_201807.nc
ncdump -h /esarchive/recon/jma/jra55/monthly_mean/tas-640x320_f6h/tas_201007.nc
```

Please, could you take a look? If there is a file format problem, I wonder if you can fix it. However, if it follows the standards, please, let me know, so, I will work on making Load more flexible to read these files (or change to Start).

Thanks in advance!

Request for several variables from ERA5 and SEAS5,"Hi,

We would like to make a request for several variables in the original resolution for ERA5 (hourly, 0.25ºx0.25º, 1979 to 2019) and ECMWF system5 (6hourly, 1ºx1º, 2010 to 2019). List of variables in priority order is:

- Total precipitation
- 2m temperature
- 10m u-component of wind
- 10m v-component of wind
- Total cloud cover
- Specific Humidity 700, 850 hPa
- Temperature 500 hPa
- Geopotential 500, 1000hPa
- Sea surface temperature.

As agreed with @msamso, in case of limited disk space alternatives can be the following ones also in preferable order:
1) Convert to daily means and remove subdaily resolution files.
2) Use an extended european domain instead of global. Latitude, longitude domain corners would be 28N-78N-19W-38E
3) Limit the number of variables. The list above is ordered in priority order.

JRA55 psl-640x320 corrupted files,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere 

We have found some corrupted files regarding to both paths /esarchive/recon/jma/jra55/daily_mean and /esarchive/recon/jma/jra55/monthly_mean. Concretely:

1.  
*  Path:/esarchive/recon/jma/jra55/daily_mean/psl-640x320_f6h
*  Variables: daily mean psl
*  Grid : 640x320
*  Frequency : f6h
*  Observations: the data files psl-640x320_f6h shows the pressure at surface level, instead of the mean sea-level pressure. However, the data files psl_f6h are not corrupted and correspond to the mean sea-level pressure. That makes me think that maybe, the conversion to the grid 640x320 has been made from ps files instead of from psl files.

Wrong conversion for CMAP prlr?,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso,

I believe the cmap precipiation (`/esarchive/obs/noaa/cmap/monthly_mean/prlr/*`) have been wrongly processed at BSC. The units say ""m/s"" but there is a factor of about 30 when I compare this data sets with other one (e.g. gpcp_v2.3: `/esarchive/obs/nasa/gpcp_v2.3/monthly_mean/prlr/.`). I think this is because, for some reasons, you divided the actual amount of precipitation by the number of day in the month (cf. line 12 in `/esarchive/obs/noaa/cmap/scripts/ncconv.py`). Could you please check?

Also, would it be possible to download all the historical simulations from CMIP5 for the correspondent models (all members and years since 1961). Since the historical experiments finish normally in 2005, I would also need the data from the rcp4.5 projections. These are the natural continuation if they are the same rcp number, so they could be placed in the same folder.

Finally, I have seen that data from CMIP5 in /esarchive is really bad formatted. Would it be possible to format the data and folders as the data from CMIP6?

Lon/lat names in different variables of EN4,"Hi @pabretonniere, @msamso,

I'm using EN4 datasets for the thetao and so variables from /esarchive/obs/ukmo/en4-v4.2.0/monthly_mean/.
The two datasets don't have the same names of spatial coordinates (lon/lat versus longitude/latitude). Could you homogenize the datasets please?

I don't know what is the rule regarding these names in datasets of esarchive (and if there is one) but I guess that it has to be compliant with Esmvaltool, so it would be lon/lat instead of longitude/latitude, right? (it's also to know how I have to write my scripts).

pr CESM2-WACCM and tas KACE-1-0-G faulty data,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere,

I've found four CMIP6 historical files which seem to have erroneous data. The following CESM2-WACCM files for precipitation have a bias of 10<sup>-5</sup> kg m-2 s-1. They range from 0 to 6·10<sup>-9</sup> kg m-2 s-1 instead of a more physically realistic 0 to 6·10<sup>-4</sup> kg m-2 s-1 range. I'm pretty sure this is the only issue as the maps, other that the magnitudes, look fine.

The datasets that could be useful are:

There is already a folder concerning NCEP on '/esarchive/recon/ncep/' but it's not clear to what datasets it's referred to.
- [x]  the World Ocean Atlas: https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa18/woa18data.html

- [x]  the SODA v3 reanalysis: https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds650.0/#!description. It seems according to this page http://www.soda.umd.edu/ that the year 2017 is available via this server also but maybe in a different way. 
On esarchive, we have only the vertical velocity of the former version of SODA ('esarchive/recon/ncar/soda/').

Total daily precipitation ERA5 and ECMWF-System5 C3S,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere,

In order to reproduce the results for one CSTools method (i.e. RainFARM downscaling) which will be included in the manuscript, I need the total daily precipitation instead of the daily mean.

The developer of the method has shared the method she uses to format the data:

> Regarding the dataset, I used the ERA5 dataset downloaded from Copernicus C3S at hourly time step. I aggregated the data from hourly to daily time step using CDO
> 
> cdo daysum -shifttime,-30min ..
> 
> the ""shifttime,-30min"" takes into account the fact that the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date/time, so the value at 00:00 has to be considered belonging to the previous day.  

The data I was using until now is:
/esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily_mean/prlr_s0-24h/
/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/daily_mean/prlr_f1h-r1440x721cds/

I guess you will need to create a new path or variable name since the new dataset wouldn't be 'daily_mean', maybe 'daily_total' or just 'daily'. Well, in fact there is already /esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily/prlr but I wonder if it is accumulated or the mean.

Thanks for your help with this.

CMIP6 thetao data request,"'@portega @rfernand

We have a large data request.

Please extract

	*thetao
	*so
of the following experiments:
	*DCPPA-HINDCAST
	*HISTORICAL (parcially)
	*SCENARIO ssp245 (parcially)

	*canesm5
	*ipsl-cm6a-lr
	*miroc6
	*mpi-esm1-2-hr
	*norcpm1.
The period of time we require is:	
	*DCPPA-HINDCAST: all startdates from 1960-2018.
	*HISTORICAL			1961-2014
	*SCENARIO ssp245:	2015-2029.
The data would be extracted from the url https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/ .

And saved in the proper folder of CMIP6 experiments (some of them might already have been created)

We need all available members in each case.

The data is available monthly but we only need it yearly. Is it possible to save it in yearly means (Jan-Dec) in a folder different than Omon (for example Oyr)? 

Also, we only need the North Atlantic region. Is it possible to download the data directly for the lon-lat box [0-80]ºN [90ºW - 10ºE]?. If not, is it difficult to extract that region once the data is downloaded, so that the global fields (which are heavy) do not need to be stored?

If a regular grid is available, please extract this. Otherwise, we will need to interpolate it. For that purpose, we would also need ""areacello"" for models: *bcc-csm2-mr
			*ecearth3
			*mpi-esm1-2-hr
(""areacello"" was already downloaded for the other models)

Let us know if something is unclear from the request.

Operational g500 monthly means from ERA5 and C3S seasonal prediction systems,"Hi, in S2S4E we need to use operational forecasts of g500 from several SPS in C3S and also from ERA5. I need this data to produce operational forecasts of Euro-Atlantic teleconnections. @lpalma, this is only for a couple of webinars, so I will take care of making the computations myself, no need to run operational scripts after the download, just let me know when available. 

@pabretonniere & @msamso I think you downloaded this data for me a while back (issues #820, #905 and #927), but I think @lpalma has been working on the operational vars recently, right? not sure who should take care now.

**Reanalysis:**
* [x] ERA5 (/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/g500_f1h)

**Seasonal:**
* [x] ECMWF_SEAS5_C3S (/esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/monthly_mean/g500_f12h)
* [x] DWD_SYS2_C3S (/esarchive/exp/dwd/system2_m1/monthly_mean/g500_f12h)
* [x] CMCC_SYS3_C3S (/esarchive/exp/cmcc/system3_m1-c3s/monthly_mean/g500_f12h)
* [x] GLOSEA5_SYS15_C3S (/esarchive/exp/ukmo/glosea5_system15-c3s/monthly_mean/g500_f12h)
* [x] MF_SYS7_C3S (/esarchive/exp/meteofrance/system7c3s/monthly_mean/g500_f12h)


For some of the datasets there is only a small gap that would be nice to fill up. 
For MF_SYS7_C3S the whole hindcast is missing also, and would be nice to have it too.
If you have to prioritize I would say, start with ERA5 and ECMWF SEAS5, then DWD and CMCC, and finally GLOSEA5 and MFSYS7.

corrupted file in tas ECMWF SEAS5 2017,"Hi,

Having a look a correlation in ECMWF SEAS5, I found that the startdate 20170501 seems to be corrupted. Figure attached shows the monthly tas averaged in MJJA over Europe including sea points, for all the ensemble members. The period is 1981-2018, the strange values occur in 2017.

`/esarchive/exp/ecearth/omip[1-2]`, which is what was published on the ESGF. For this one, I need to first unpublish the problematic variables, correct them and republish. It shouldn't take long anyway.

ORAS5 nudging files for decadal prediction,"Hi @vsicardi @portega @rfernand 

After talking to Valentina, I'm creating this new (clean) issue to discuss more precisely the **ORAS5 nudging files needed for the 2020 DCPP experiment**.


There are many different things in https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/499 and it will be easier to put things here for once.

Valentina was using this data:
`/esarchive/releases/nudging/ocean/s5/ORCA025L75_ORAS5`, 

then she did a geographical subset in `/esarchive/releases/nudging/ocean/s5/ORCA025L75/fc0 `

and finally interpolate them to ORCA1 in `/esarchive/releases/nudging/ocean/s5/ORCA1L75/fc00`.




Note that we only have one member in` /esarchive/releases/nudging/ocean/s5/ORCA025L75`, while we have 5 in `/esarchive/releases/nudging/ocean/s5/ORCA025L75_ORAS5`.

Format of the files should be `s5_fc${member}_${year}.nc`.



They initially come from `ec:/emos/OCEA/5/0001/opa${member}/output/$year/`

area_weighted ESMValTool's regrid method fails for OBS data,"Hi @jvegas and @pabretonniere 

The ESMValTool preprocessor fails when trying to regrid reanalysis or observational precipitation files to a 1x1 degree grid with the `area_weighted` method. The preprocessor is supposed to be guessing bounds as the log says:
```

 Long name for pr changed from total precipitation to Precipitation
 Added guessed bounds to coordinate lon from var lon
 Added guessed bounds to coordinate lat from var lat

Nevertheless, when it tries to regrid the following error arises:
```
ValueError: The horizontal grid coordinates of both the source and grid cubes must have contiguous bounds.

ESMValTool concat error between historical and projection datasets,"Hi @pabretonniere 

I've collected the CMIP6 datasets that have issues when trying to concatenate their historical and projection datasets inside the ESMValTool's recipe preprocessor. The run crashes even if it is run with the relaxed level_check. A recipe with the models that raise concat errors can be found at `/esarchive/scratch/jcos/esmvaltool/recipes/test_concat_error.yml` 
 
The datasets giving errors are the following (issues might come from differences in the grids):

* **AWI-CM-1-1-MR**: the latitude long_name for **pr** datasets of **ssp126**, **ssp245**, **ssp585** scenarios is ""**L**atitude"" and for the **pr** **historical** the long_name is ""**l**atitude"". Only the member **r1i1p1f1** is used. The error log is the following: `ValueError: Can not concatenate cubes: failed to concatenate into a single cube.
  Dimension coordinates metadata differ: latitude != latitude`

* **CESM2**: The last significant digits of the ybounds (lat_bnds) have differences between **historical** and projection(**ssp126**, **ssp245**, **ssp585**) datasets for the variables **tas** and **psl**. Only the member **r1i1p1f1** is used. The error log is the following: `ValueError: Can not concatenate cubes: failed to concatenate into a single cube.
  Dimension coordinates metadata differ: latitude, longitude != latitude, longitude`

* **CESM2-WACCM**: The same issue as **CESM2** but only for the **psl** **ssp245** dataset. Only the member **r1i1p1f1** is used. You have been trying to solve it for this dataset's **historical-ssp245** concatenation and now according to the error log also `time != time`

* **NorESM2-LM**: The first and last values of the **longitude bounds** have been found to differ between the **historical** and projections (**ssp126**, **ssp245** and **ssp585**) datasets of the variables **pr**, **psl** and **tas**. Only the member **r1i1p1f1** is used. There might be more to it than just the xbounds differences as the error log says the following: `""ValueError: Can not concatenate cubes: failed to concatenate into a single cube.
  An unexpected problem prevented concatenation.
  Expected only a single cube, found 2.""`

GFAS monthly_mean,"Hi @pabretonniere @msamso 

for the CONFESS project which just started (of which WP2 leader is @rfernand) we need the monthly_mean of several biomass burning emissions from GFAS.

It seems the daily_means are already in multivar files in /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/gfas/daily_mean/multivar and kept up-to-date, which is great!

Would you do the monthly mean for all variables or only the ones we need?

here is the list of variables from the CAMS/GFAS page we need https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/CAMS%3A+Global+Fire+Assimilation+System+%28GFAS%29+data+documentation#CAMS:GlobalFireAssimilationSystem(GFAS)datadocumentation-ListofGFASparameters

| Wildfire flux of Particulate Matter PM2.5 | pm2p5fire | kg m-2 s-1 | 87.210  |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Wildfire flux of Total Particulate Matter | tpmfire   | kg m-2 s-1 | 88.210  |
| Wildfire flux of Total Carbon in Aerosols | tcfire    | kg m-2 s-1 | 89.210  |
| Wildfire flux of Organic Carbon           | ocfire    | kg m-2 s-1 | 90.210  |

| Wildfire combustion rate                  | crfire    | kg m-2 s-1 | 100.210 |

It seems the variables names are slightly different in the daily_mean variables, juste need to remove the -fire

As mentioned in our last DDT meeting, I need to run some recipes for a [ESMValTool paper](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-244/).

  - [ ] RCP 8.5, period 2021-2050

I need also to use a land-sea mask for all these models. ESMValTool looks for the variable `sftlf` (percentage of land covered by lakes) or `sftof` (percentage of grid cell covered by ocean). One of these variables would be enough.

Missing years in ERA-20C monthly,"Hi (again),

I was trying to process some monthly data from ECMWF ERA-20C that are already in esarchive, but I noticed that some years are missing. 

I only checked few random levels, but it looks like `ta` is missing 1913, as well as the last year, which should be 2010. Also, `ua` and `va `only reach 2008. Maybe there are other years that are missing (I only noticed 1913 because that's where my script stopped), so could this be checked, and could you please download the missing data? 

I'm very sorry because I think that I am the one who requested those data few years ago, but I didn't notice this problem :( At that time, I only used g, which seems to be fine. 

At the moment I don't really need va, so there's no real need to re-download them (but I would maybe remove them?).

Improve/replace ecmwf reanalysis surface forcing scripts,"Hi @pabretonniere together with @vlapin @acarreri  and other we are looking into downloading the surface forcings from the ERA5 ""ENDA"" ensemble reanalysis.

I have almost downloaded all of member 0 using the scripts found here: https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/cp/cpg-shared-tools/-/tree/master/Generation%20of%20ICs/Downloading%20scripts/ecmwf_surface_forcings

You can find some examples of the resulting output here : /gpfs/projects/bsc32/bsc32051/ERA_FORCING/era5-enda

I used the same script to download the era-hres .

We then interpolate them to netcdf files in the raw regular gaussian grid.  The result can be something like this : /gpfs/projects/bsc32/bsc32051/NEMO_FORCING/era5-hres-aude

The problem is that these scripts are very slow (I estimate about 1 month for 1 member, when doing 3 downloads concurrently which seems to be the max).  One problem is mars is very slow recently, and these scripts do a ton of mars requests.

Do you think you might be able to improve these scripts?  It is important for use to have the data in the raw reduced gaussian grid, not the CDS grid.

Here is how to use them, in ecgate I launch a given period (monthly chunks) with:

`sbatch ./main_extract.ksh ea 201810 202012 1 MON 0`

we can discuss this in person at your leisure.

UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX data,"Hello, for advancing downscaling methodologies with @lpalma and @cgome1 in several ESS projects and also in CES (DL approaches) we need some data from UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX:

- Variables: tas and sfcWind
- Grid: can you interpolate it to a regular 0.05x0.05 grid?  We think a conservative interpolation could be used, but we are open to discuss it. It would be good to compare the native and final grid for one example at least, to make sure we selected a good final resolution.

- High priority:

- [x] sfcwind: all from 1979 to 1993
- [x] psl: 201701 202003 202010 202011 202012

- Not so High priority (:smile: ):

- [x] ta850: missing from 1979 to 2006
- [x] ua850: missing all
- [x] va850: missing all
- [x] hurs: missing all
- [x] huss: missing all
- [x] hur850: missing all
- [x] hus850: missing all for 2020

To start working ASAP we will need to fill the gaps in the high priority list, spcecially everything before 2020. The rest, will be needed in the short-term but they are not critical right now.

Wrong time attributes of HadISST and HadGEM3_dcppA-hindcast monthly data,"Hi @pabretonniere @msamso 

I found two data that may have incorrect time attributes.

1. `/esarchive/obs/ukmo/hadisst_v1.1/monthly_mean/tos/`  
For example, `tos_200505.nc` has time = 1624 with units ""months since 1870-01-16 12:00:00"", so the real time should be ""2005-05-16 12:00:00"" if I calculate it right. The time I see with *ncdump -ctv time* is ""2005-05-01"".

2. `/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/dcppA-hindcast/hadgem3-gc31-mm/cmip6-dcppA-hindcast_i1p1/DCPP/MOHC/HadGEM3-GC31-MM/dcppA-hindcast/r1i1p1f2/Amon/tas/gr/v20200316`

sfcWind:standard_name metadata discrepancies in CMIP6 datasets,"Hi @msamso,

I've found differences in the metadata of sfcWind datasets in CMIP6. Some have `sfcWind:standard_name = ""eastward_wind""` and others `sfcWind:standard_name = ""wind_speed""` (which I guess is the correct one). 

The issue is that ESMValTool crashes if the metadata from two files from the same model differ. Would it be possible to homogenize the `sfcWind:standard_name` for all sfcWind CMIP6 data?

An example of two files from the same model with different sfcWind:standard name are:

  - From year 2004 there is `time_bnds` and metadata (`time:bounds` and `tos:cell_methods`) included, which don't exist for the period 1979-2003. This inhomogeneity is avoiding concatenation in ESMValTool. Could it be homogenized?
  - from year 2009-2018 the lat and lon variables are defined as `float` instead of `double`. Could the dataset be homogenized either to `double` or `float`? I don't know which is the preferred way.

New para nomads website coming
We are currently working to stand up a para NOMADS in our College Park data center to support NCO's transition from WCOSS to WCOSS2 in 2022. The URL is https://para-nomads-cprk.ncep.noaa.gov/ but it is not serving active data at this time.

NOMADS upgrade coming
Within the next 12 months we will be upgrading the NOMADS website. Functionality should remain the same for existing scripts for grib filter, HTTPS downloads, and openDAP services, but the NOMADS front end webpage as well as the grib filter pages will see some changes. A test version of the upgraded website will be available before the upgrade, and an SCN advertising the changes will also be published and passed along here. There will be no changes to FTPPRD associated with this upgrade.

Monthly mean observation's timestamp homogeneization,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere 

I open this issue just to bring forward the possibility of homogenising the timestamps of all the available `obs` and `recon` `monthly_mean` datasets at `/esarchive`.

At the moment there are datasets with values located either at the begining, middle or end of the month of the time dimension. I'd like to ask if it would be feasible and reasonable to homogenise them all to the middle of the month. I'm not certain on the impact that this could have on the work being done by the rest of the users and if there would be a way around that. 

Overall, would the trouble be worth worth for consistency and ease when using very constraining tools such as ESMValTool?

Issues identified by @etourign :

1. [ ] data is still on @gcarella scratch folder
1. [ ] files should be global and not only by GFED region
1. [ ] data is rotated by 90% and perhaps even flipped
1. [ ] data should be compressed
1. [ ] need to use native data type (unsigned byte), or short instead of much larger double and range should be from 0/254 instead of -127/128 as currently
1. [ ] data from 2016-2019 (v2.1.1) is missing - I think everything should be moved to one folder e.g. /esarchive/obs/esa/landcovercci
1. [ ] doing bilinear regridding of LC (Land Cover) is wrong, the ""dominant"" (or most frequent) LC class should be used instead of the ""average"" of LC classes which does not make sense",1465,https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/1465,Closed,gcarella,gcarella,Pierre-Antoine Bretonnière,pabretonniere,No,No,,2021-03-03 12:20:07,2022-04-25 16:07:04,2022-04-25 16:07:04,,,"Data,Working on it",0,0

6h u+v SMHI / DMI data,"hi @pabretonniere 

referring to your email about /esarchive/scratch usage: I have quite a lot of 6h raw grib DMI/SMHI data in my scratch that aren't formatted yet. have a look here: /esarchive/scratch/swild/DMI-SMHI_hindcasts_uas+vas. It's probably better if the data will be stored in /esarchive/exp as netcdf following the steps that you suggested a while ago in https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/Experiments/-/issues/193#note_102579 

* selection of the good timesteps in the grib (for instantaneous, we simply read the whole ICMGG${exp}+${year}${month}
* conversion from grib to netcdf
* writing of the metadata

Honestly, I don't know which dataset I should use. For instance, @jacosta told me to use this one: `/esarchive/obs/nasa/nsidc-nasa-v2.1/monthly_mean/sie/` but after accidentally removed two files, @pabretonniere is not able easily to know from where these data come from (cf this [issue](https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/1471)).

So, can we decide to clean all these folders, keeping only the last updated and used ones?

Also, I think you're computing the sie and other derived variables in our own folders. But maybe it could be interesting to have these variables there, as it's already done for some of these datasets? It would be easier for beginners like me that don't have a script to compute the sie (I know I can ask you), easier to maintain, it will be better for reproducibility and it will save space on /esarchive in general (rather than having duplicate data on each of our own scratch).

What do you think?
If you agree, can you precise which folders are the good one? 

Thanks

Need for ESMValTool checks when re/downloading data,"I open this issue to ask if it would be possible to run ESMValTool checks before downloading new data or redownloading old data and also to bring forward ideas on how it could be efficiently done.

An example where tests could come in handy: I tried to run an old recipe that concatenates historical and scenario runs of CMIP6 datasets and then preprocesses them. The recipe failed yesterday as the historical files for tas ACCESS-CM2 were either redownloaded or slightly modified on the 10th of February (according to the file's history). This resulted in some metadata being different from the scenario files and now the recipe can't concatenate them. 

We talked with @pabretonniere, @jvegas and @sloosvel about the possibility of adding a step in the download workflow where a basic recipe would be run to check the data can be digested by ESMValTool. I here list some things that would be nice to consider for this check (I don't know if they all are feasible. If they aren't please let me know):
* run the whole new downloaded data period to check that concatenation performs well.
* If the downloaded data is a chunk or continuation of already existing data (e.g. observations, reanalysis...), the whole period of old and new data should be run to check concatenation
* If a projections file is redownloaded or modified it might be affecting the ability to concatenate not only its experiment_id but also the others, i.e. as in the example if a historical file is modified it should be checked that the historical-scenario concatenation is not affected.

I think those are the main 3 points to consider. I hope it isn't much trouble and that it can be applied.

Thanks,

HadSLP v2 time units and metadata inhomogeneities,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere 

I've found some metadata issues/inhomogeneities in the HadSLP v2 dataset that prevent ESMValTool from preprocessing it. 

* From year 1850 to 2004 the variables metadata looks like this:


```
variables:
	float longitude(longitude) ;
		longitude:standard_name = ""longitude"" ;
		longitude:long_name = ""Longitude"" ;
		longitude:units = ""degrees_east"" ;
		longitude:axis = ""X"" ;
	float latitude(latitude) ;
		latitude:standard_name = ""latitude"" ;
		latitude:long_name = ""Latitude"" ;
		latitude:units = ""degrees_north"" ;
		latitude:axis = ""Y"" ;
	double time(time) ;
		time:standard_name = ""time"" ;
		time:units = ""day as %Y%m%d.%f"" ;
		time:calendar = ""proleptic_gregorian"" ;
	float psl(time, latitude, longitude) ;
		psl:standard_name = ""sea_level_pressure"" ;
		psl:long_name = ""Sea level pressure"" ;
		psl:units = ""Pa"" ;
		psl:var_desc = ""Sea Level Pressure"" ;
		psl:unit_long = ""Pascal"" ;
```
Issues arise due to the `time:units` description and the fact that the actual time value equals 0. Check for example: `ncdump -v time /esarchive/obs/ukmo/hadslp_v2/monthly_mean/psl/psl_200001.nc`

* From year 2005 to 2012 variable metadata is:
```
variables:
	int longitude(longitude) ;
		longitude:axis = ""Y"" ;
		longitude:long_name = ""longitude"" ;
		longitude:units = ""degrees_east"" ;
	float latitude(latitude) ;
		latitude:units = ""degrees_north"" ;
		latitude:long_name = ""latitude"" ;
		latitude:axis = ""X"" ;
	float psl(time, latitude, longitude) ;
		psl:units = ""Pa"" ;
		psl:units_long = ""Pascal"" ;
	int time ;
		time:units = ""days since 1850-01-01"" ;
		time:axis = ""T"" ;
```
* From year 2013 to 2018 variable metadata is:
```
variables:
        float lat(lat) ;
		lat:standard_name = ""latitude"" ;
		lat:long_name = ""latitude"" ;
		lat:units = ""degrees_north"" ;
		lat:axis = ""Y"" ;
	float lon(lon) ;
		lon:standard_name = ""longitude"" ;
		lon:long_name = ""longitude"" ;
		lon:units = ""degrees_east"" ;
		lon:axis = ""X"" ;
	float psl(time, lat, lon) ;
		psl:_FillValue = 32767.f ;
		psl:actual_range = 953.9066f, 1052.509f ;
		psl:dataset = ""HadSLP2"" ;
		psl:least_significant_digit = 1s ;
		psl:level_desc = ""Surface"" ;
		psl:long_name = ""Monthly Mean Sea Level Pressure"" ;
		psl:missing_value = 32767s ;
		psl:parent_stat = ""Individual Observation"" ;
		psl:precision = 1s ;
		psl:statistic = ""Mean"" ;
		psl:units = ""Pa"" ;
		psl:unpacked_valid_range = 850.f, 1400.f ;
		psl:var_desc = ""Sea Level Pressure"" ;
	double time(time) ;
		time:standard_name = ""time"" ;
		time:long_name = ""Time"" ;
		time:units = ""days since 1800-1-1 00:00:00"" ;
		time:calendar = ""standard"" ;
		time:axis = ""T"" ;
```

For now the only error ESMValTool raises is for the time units in the period 1850-2005. The metadata inhomogeneities are prone to generate concatenation errors, but I'd say we first solve the time units and test if it concatenates alright. If it doesn't, I guess it'd be a matter of homogenising the metadata.

Would changing the `time:units` affect other users using this dataset?

Global monthly gridded sea surface pCO2,"Hi,

can we please have the following dataset?

**MPI_SOM-FFN_v2020**

and its related README:  **README_Document_v2020.pdf**	

this is just a suggestion about where they should go:

and 

esarchive/obs/mpi/spco2/climatology/spco2_MPI-SOM_FFN_v2020_CLIM.nc	


I do not know why they are hosted in this noaa website even if they are from Max Planck Institute (mpi). I would prefer to have them in an new mpi folder (since they are from mpi) and not in noaa folder( even if we download them from there).

I discussed about this with @eyilmaz, who also uses this dataset, and she agrees with me

thank you very much

Homogeneisation of observational products for ESMValTool,"Hi @msamso , @pabretonniere ,

I need to use some datasets that are not well homogenized, to be used by ESMValTool.
It concerns:
 - HadISST v1.1 (`/esarchive/obs/ukmo/hadisst_v1.1/monthly_mean/tos`)
 - ersst (`/esarchive/obs/noaa/ersst_v5/monthly_mean/tos`)

For these two datasets, the problem comes from the longitude,latitude that should be lon,lat.
~~~
esmvalcore.cmor.check.CMORCheckError: There were errors in variable tos:
Coordinate longitude has var name longitude instead of lon
 Coordinate latitude has var name latitude instead of lat
~~~

 - ERA5 (`/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/tos_f1h-r1440x721cds`)

For this dataset, I have this error:
~~~
2021-05-27 18:11:32,966 UTC [26097] ERROR   Can not concatenate cubes into a single one: failed to concatenate into a single cube.
  Cube metadata differs for phenomenon: sea_surface_temperature
  Dimension coordinates metadata differ: time != time
~~~ 

From the file 1970-01 to 1978-12, it's ok. At least the 197901 arises this issue but it's probably not the only one.

Can you check the consistency for all the dates available for each dataset please?

Many thanks.

Homogenisation of the /esarchvie/exp/CMIP6 file tree structure,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso 

At the moment there are CMIP6 file links under `/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/{dataset}/cmip6-{expid}/` and under `/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/{dataset}/cmip6-{expid}/{activity}/{institute}/{dataset}/{exp}/{ensemble}/{mip}/{short_name}/{grid}/{latestversion}`. This is a bit messy, specially when the amount of links under the first subfolder is not coinciding with the links under the whole tree. Would it be possible to create the whole tree links with the available data under /esarchive/exp/{dataset}?

With @pabretonniere we have discussed that the best approach would be to:
* 1: Create the links under the long tree structure (`/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/{dataset}/cmip6-{expid}/{activity}/{institute}/{dataset}/{exp}/{ensemble}/{mip}/{short_name}/{grid}/{latestversion}`)
* 2: Erase the links under `/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/{dataset}/cmip6-{expid}/` and communicate the change to the department or the users that might be using this structure
* 3: Create a Cron task, that runs regularly, which checks and fixes broken links that can be caused by changes/updates in the original files under `/esarchive/exp/{dataset}`

Hopefully this can help having a cleaner and more comprehensive CMIP file structure inside esarchive.

Thanks!

Converting data on NEMO grid to lon-lat,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso 

I am trying to convert some simulation outputs to a regular lon-lat grid. I am using the following CDO command

where era5_lonlat_grid.txt gives the target grid.

Looking at the outputs of this command there is a column with missing data.

When plotting the model data in the original grid, you can see that this line correspond to the right limit of the grid.

rotated lat lons in MONARCH files: how to obtain indices ?,"Hello @pabretonniere , @fbeninca  , @molid , @sbasart 

For vitiGEOSS project we are going to provide short-term meteo variables from regional MONARCH runs to other partners. 
Although we will provide the full domain regional files, the interest of the partners is to extract timeseries of particular locations where the vineyards are. We would like to provide to the partners with these specific indices that they need to select for each vineyard. I have been trying to identify the indices (using startR) but as these are rotated latitudes and longitudes it is not working as with normal latitudes and longitudes. How can we do this? Do you know if startR can handle these coordinates? 

Perhaps we could have a meeting to understand the rotated lat lons and how to convert them? I guess to extract a single point a conversion is not needed (just identifying the indices); but in case we/them need to use the full map, then may be we don need a conversion. 

In particlar the files are from:

/esarchive/exp/monarch/a2in/regional/3hourly/

And we have them linked ready for the THREDDS here ([issue 1405](https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/1405)):

/esarchive/exp/VITIGEOSS/short_term/3hourly

The locations for which we need to identify the indices in the netCDF file are: 

|       Parcel       |    lat    |  lon   |  
|--------------------|-----------|--------|
| Sant Martí Sarroca | 41.375    | 1.630  |

CMIP directories simplification,"Hi @cp 


With @jcos and @msamso we've been discussing about simplifying the directory structure of the CMIP(5/6) folders in esarchive. This will ease the ""manual"" browsing and will simplify the configuration of ESMVal (@sloosvel @jvegas).

It's only a proposal for now, but this might impact your scripts, so please let us know if you have anything against this.


Current situation:

`/esarchive/exp/${project}/${exp}/${model}/${project}-${exp}_i0p${p}/ followed by the official cmor tree `

eg:

`/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/historical/miroc6/cmip6-historical_i0p1/CMIP/MIROC/MIROC6/historical/r1i1p1f1/Amon/tas/gn/v20200101/tas_Amon_MIROC6_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_195001-201412.nc`

Our proposal is to remove the level ${project}-${exp}_i0p${p} so that final path would be:

`/esarchive/exp/${project}/${exp}/${model} followed by the official cmor tree `

eg:

`/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/historical/miroc6/CMIP/MIROC/MIROC6/historical/r1i1p1f1/Amon/tas/gn/v20200101/tas_Amon_MIROC6_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_195001-201412.nc`


The other proposal (even simpler) would have been to use directly the CMOR tree (`/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/CMIP/MIROC/MIROC6/historical/r1i1p1f1/Amon/tas/gn/v20200101/tas_Amon_MIROC6_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_195001-201412.nc`) but we think it is easier for you all to access first to the experiment and then to the model, and in addition this is much more ""disruptive"" so we discarded this option.

Taking advantage of this reorganization, we will also remove the links in the ""flat directory"" `/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/historical/miroc6/cmip6-historical_i0p1/` without cmor tree . 

I also take advantage of this to remind you that the files in /esarchive/exp/CMIP6 are only links and that they can also be found directly in /esarchive/exp/$model/$exp.

Any feedback is welcome. Else we will proceed to this change in the coming days.

I'm working with the BADC to convert our DCPP data into the new format we designed in the C3S_34c contract for them to integrate the data in the Climate Data Store.

For this, I would need 3 new global attributes: initialization_description, physics_description, and forcing_description.

Can you give me a sentence for each please?

For the initialization, we have some info in the variant info (`variant_info = ""Atmosphere initialization based on full-fields from ERA-Interim (s1979-s2018) or ERA-40 (s1960-s1978); ocean/sea-ice initialization based on full-fields from NEMO/LIM assimilation run nudged towards ORA-S4 (s1960-s2018)`) and the experiment (`experiment = ""hindcast initialized based on observations and using historical forcing"" ;`), but I would need something a bit less general.

Also, do you know how these descriptions would differ between the different contributions from the different C3S_34C partners?

as you can see the array shifts from having the days centered in the month. Is this an issue with the way the time coordinate has been saved? or could this have also affected the data values? Can it be fixed?

era5 monthly_mean psl_f1h  lon and lat coordinate names (CMOR issue),"Hi @pabretonniere 

The coordinate names for the files `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/psl_f1h/psl_*.nc` are longitude and latitude instead of lon and lat, as ESMValTool's CMOR checker demands. Simply relaxing the cmor checker is not a good solution because then the fixes to the lat/lon are not applied on the fly, meaning that some preprocessors break further down the way. Could they be changed to lat and lon? Will this affect other users?

FGOALS-f3-L ssp245 metadata inhomogeneities,"Hi @msamso 

There is some metadata inhomogeneities between historical and ssp245 pr, psl and tas files for member r1i1p1f1 of model FGOALS-f3-L. This is preventing concatenation of historical-ssp245 runs. 

The lat and lon bounds metadata from historical files are as follows:
```
	double lat_bnds(lat, bnds) ;
		lat_bnds:axis = ""Y"" ;
		lat_bnds:bounds = ""lat_bnds"" ;
		lat_bnds:long_name = ""Latitude"" ;

		lon_bnds:axis = ""X"" ;
		lon_bnds:bounds = ""lon_bnds"" ;
		lon_bnds:long_name = ""Longitude"" ;
		lon_bnds:standard_name = ""longitude"" ;
		lon_bnds:units = ""degrees_east"" ;

The ones from the ssp245 files are as follows:
```
        double lat_bnds(lat, bnds) ;
	double lon_bnds(lon, bnds) ;

Could the histoircal attributes of the `lat_bnds` and `lon_bnds` be added to the ssp245 files under `/esarchive/exp/fgoals-f3-l/cmip6-ssp245_i1p1/original_files/cmorfiles/ScenarioMIP/CAS/FGOALS-f3-L/ssp245/r1i1p1f1/Amon/*/*/*`?

Thank you in advance.

ERA-Interim download surface solar radiation,"Hi @pabretonniere , @msamso 

I need to use surface shortwave radiation fluxes (monthly average) from ERA-Interim. At the moment in ""/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/erainterim/monthly_means/"" I can only see fluxes for longwave radiation (rls_s12-24h), but for shortwave there is only downward radiation, not the flux (downward minus upward).

Could you please download monthly data for surface solar (shortwave) radiation? The name of the variable should be rss (not rsds). 

Thank you very much in advance,

BerkeleyEarth tas gridded observations,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere ,

Some time ago I dowloaded the BerkeleyEarth monthly gridded surface temperature observations from the ESMValTool cmorizer. The file is stored at `/esarchive/scratch/jcos/rawobs/Tier2/BerkeleyEarth`. I think it could be interesting to move it to /esarchive/obs with the usual structure (the file names, one file per month...). 

This issue is very low priority.

ORAS5 daily data - SST,"Hi @pabretonniere , @msamso ,

We will need daily data of sea surface temperature from ORAS5. 

I couldn't find already downloaded daily data in `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/oras5/original_files/` (in `/esarchive/releases/nudging/ocean/s5/ORCA025L75_ORAS5` neither but I guess that these files are processed data from `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/oras5/original_files/`). 

In the history of these original_files, 5 days files are mentioned, which could be the original files at daily frequency that we need here, but I don't know where to ask for them. 

Another point is that it's probably a lot of data to download because we probably have to download the 3D files with all variables (grid_T) only to keep the surface temperature at the end. So we can begin with the year 1980, maybe only with January if it's too many data.

In all these issues it is suggested to trim the orca grid before interpolating it. However I cannot understand how to select the ""magic numbers"" to trim the grid.

ORAS5 datasets to homogeneize,"Hi @msamso , @pabretonniere ,

I'd like to load the files of oras5 with xarray (packages from Python) but with some files I got this error:
~~~
ValueError: dimension 'time' already exists as a scalar variable
~~~

It concerns files in:
* `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/oras5/monthly_mean/votemper/opa0/`: for instance votemper_201710.nc
* `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/oras5/monthly_mean/sosstsst/`: for instance for the months 199509, 199512, 199601. 

For the second folder, time is a `int` variable and `time_counter` is defined as coordinate in the metadata of the `sosstsst` variable. I think the error comes from the coordinate in the metadata of sosstsst (but maybe because time is a `int` variable?). The files which are concerned seem to have been all produced the 13/10/2020 (but I haven't checked all the files).

For `votemper`, it seems also to be linked with `time_counter` being defined as coordinate in the variable and not `time`. I haven't found any file in opa0 that I can open. But I have no problem with opa1 for instance (where no time dimension is defined in the metadata of `votemper`). 

Could you have a look at it please and modify first the coordinate metadata of the variables?

Many thanks.

EC-Earth3 calendar inhomogeneities,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso 

EC-Earth3 datasets are giving trouble with ESMValTool as there are calendar inhomogeneities between the historical runs and the scenario runs. The log error looks as follows:
```
can not be concatenated: time units days since 1850-1-1 00:00:00, calendar gregorian and days since 1850-1-1 00:00:00, calendar proleptic_gregorian differ
```
The datasets are the ones that were downloaded and tested in https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/1523 and they weren't giving trouble. Have the files been modified or could it be a new issue with ESMValTool?

Download of sea ice thickness data from ESA-CCI catalogue,"Hi @msamso,

Would it please be possible to download the sea ice thickness data [here](https://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/esacci/sea_ice/data/sea_ice_thickness/L3C), from both Envisat and Cryosat2? 

Each file contains not only sea ice thickness, but also sea ice concentration. Both variables would be worth keeping. Only the northern hemisphere data is needed. If something is not clear, just ask.  

Thanks a lot!

Update of datasets metadata for ESMValTool 2.2 checker,"Hi @msamso , @sloosvel ,

As mentioned in this [issue](https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/1309#note_144880), the new version of ESMValTool has an even more demanding checker. 

At least an error related to the vertical dimension will arise from the var_name. 
cf this error (´/esarchive/scratch/acarreri/esmvaltool/monitor.560128_en4_olevel.out´):
~~~
esmvalcore.cmor.check.CMORCheckError: There were errors in variable thetao:
Generic level coordinate olevel has wrong var_name.
 in cube:
sea_water_potential_temperature / (kelvin) (time: 1; depth: 42; latitude: 173; longitude: 360)
~~~

I'm not sure about what needs to be modified in the metadata. @sloosvel, can you describe it? Are there other new implementations in ESMValTool that will prevent us from using our datasets?

I list here the different datasets that I'm using and that will need to be updated (or to be checked it they are already following the correct convention):
- [ ] en4-v4.2.1: thetao and so (´/esarchive/obs/ukmo/en4-v4.2.1/monthly_mean/´)
- [ ] cora: thetao and so (`/esarchive/obs/cmems/cora/monthly/`)
- [ ] ishiikimotov6.13: thetao and so (`/esarchive/obs/aori/ishiikimotov6.13/monthly/`)

Don't you mind to check these datasets with the new requirements of ESMValTool when you'll have time?

Many thanks

Ersst v5 issue in the longitude data of the last months,"Hi @msamso , @pabretonniere 

There is a problem in the longitudes/latitudes values of the last months of the ersst v5 dataset ('/esarchive/obs/noaa/ersst_v5/monthly_mean/tos/'). 

When applying an ESMValTool script, I have this error message:

When opening the last files with ncview, the lon and lat dimension appear indeed with the value of usual `missing values` (9.96 e36). 

I think that the files concerned are from 202002 to 202012 (they are also heavier of the other ones).

Could you check what is wrong with them? Not so obvious to me.

CMIP6 tos metadata and data fixes to run with ESMValTool,"Hi @msamso 

I've found some inhomogeneities and issues between historical and ssp245 tos datasets for CMIP6. As always, it's a matter of ESMValTool being consistent and strict before performing any preprocessing duty.

I'm only testing the concatenation of the historical-ssp245 experiments, but the same issues might be applicable to other ssp experiment concatenations. Most of the issues have to do with float and double values in the lat lon coordinates of the experiments. 

To make it easier to navigate around this issue I'll open a new comment for each of the datasets. So each dataset will have a dedicated comment thread. Does that sound reasonable?

CORDEX CCLM4-8-17 unable to be concatenated by ESMVal,"Hi @pabretonniere 

CORDEX datasets from the regional model CCLM4-8-17 all arise a concatenation error (irrespective of which GCM is used). Concatenation complains about metadata differences in the time coordinate and the data types being different:
```
ValueError: Can not concatenate cubes: failed to concatenate into a single cube.
  Dimension coordinates metadata differ: time != time
  Data types differ: float32 != >f4
```
What I don't understand is that there are no metadata differences in the time coordinate nor in the coordinate's data types between files (tried nccmp and vimdiff in the ncdumps and ncinfos). 

What's even stranger is that there is no definite year where files can't concatenate. No matter the time period I test, ESMVal can only concatenate the first 2 files. 

- If I try years 1981-2010 it concatenates 1981-2000 (files 1981-1990 and 1991-2000) and then breaks at 2001
- If I try years 1991-2020 it concatenates 1991-2005 (files 1991-2000 and 2001-2005) and then breaks at 2006 
- If I try years 2001-2030 it concatenates 2001-2010 (files 2001-2005 and 2006-2010) and then breaks at 2011
- If I try years 2011-2040 it concatenates 2011-2030 (files 2011-2020 and 2021-2030) and then breaks at 2031

So there isn't a jump between two specific files that causes this error.

- [x] COPEPOD (NOAA): `/esarchive/obs/noaa/copepod/` Variables: total zooplankton biomass integrated between 0 and 200 m


The intention of cmorizing this data is so that it can ultimately be used by ESMValTool to compare observed and NEMO outputs on an ORCA1 grid. I'm working on the regridding. For the variables listed that are not cmip, we'll probably have to create new json tables. If there's any issue with any of these datasets, let us know.

Formatting ERA5 (HRES and ENDA) surface forcing files,"Hi @etourign and @pabretonniere,

I am creating this issue to bring to the logical end our efforts to download and format era5-enda surface forcing data, which started here #1418. I was running the download `a3hr` during the last month and it has finished successfully. Now it is only a matter of applying the final formatting. Because of the issue with the formatting (precip was rain-only instead of total precipitation, i.e. liquid and solid https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/auto-ecearth3/-/issues/1645), we should correct the formatting scripts before applying them. The final product should go into: `/gpfs/projects/bsc32/repository/fg/ocean/ERA5_ENDA/` (currently containing fc0, 2014-only)

ENDA data is currently in two locations:
* fc0 in `/gpfs/projects/bsc32/bsc32051/ERA_FORCING/era5-enda` (downloaded by @etourign)
* fc1-9 in `/gpfs/projects/bsc32/bsc32144/ERA_FORCING/era5-enda` (downloaded by @pabretonniere, me and others)

Once this is all done, we should clean the raw data, which is currently occupying some Tb in gpfs projects and esarchive:
* raw era5-hres (including BE): 2.5T in /esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/original_files/osm_forcing/oper, @etourign downloaded 4.3T in /gpfs/projects/bsc32/bsc32051/ERA_FORCING/era5-hres
* raw era5-enda (no BE): around 0.5T

chlora vs chlos,"Hi,


Talking about observations cmorization with @mfalls , @mgalitap and @sloosvel , we've noticed that we have variables called both chlora and chlos in esarchive. The official CMOR name is chlos (https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables/blob/0fda25a9f9a943dc7097925b9d1e5f79c68a1f67/Tables/CMIP6_Omon.json#L449) but at some point, for datasets for @vsicardi , @portega and @rbernard we used the name chlora.


If you all confirm that chlora is the same variable as chlos described in the previous link, we will homogenize the directories.

Monthly tos ERA5 modification,"Hi @pabretonniere 

One test on startR is failing since yesterday. It seems related to the change in the data under `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/tos_f1h-r1440x721cds`.

startR can retrieve the data but the test fails because the values in the files are different.

I have taken a look to the files. The ones that haven't been modified since June show this var description:

		tos:units = ""K"" ;
		tos:code = 34 ;
		tos:table = 128 ;

		tos:institution = ""ECMWF"" ;
		tos:_FillValue = -9.e+33f ;
		tos:missing_value = -9.e+33f ;

snow depth data from ECMWF system5 and ERA5,"hi @msamso 
we will need in a near future to provide snow depth forecasts.

In this regard we wondered if it would be possible to get monthly means of snow depth (the nomenclature is 'sd' if I am not wrong) from: 

- ECMWF system 5 (period: from 1981 to 2017)
- ERA5 (period: from 1981 to 2017)

I found some issues related to this variable (for example https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/480) but I was not able to find anything in /esarchive

Python memory issue with 3h data,"Hi,

I am having an issue with a python script and I suspect it's a memory problem. I try to give you as many details as possible.

I use jupyter notebook on nord3, this is the script I use to launch it: /home/bsc32/bsc32774/jupyter_n3.cmd.

I want to calculate the monthly climatology (mean of all january, all february...ect) from 1980-2018 for JRA 1.4 data which have 3h frequency.

The script I use is: /home/bsc32/bsc32774/JRA_clima.ipynb

It loads and computes the climatology quite smoothly, but when I try to plot the climatology or just check the values it gets stucked.

@pabretonniere  can you have a look at it please?

Or maybe suggest another way to generate such climatology?

As far as I know with CDO I need have monthly values before calculating the climatology. Is there any other way?

Thank you so much

Effect of precision in real workflow,"Hi @lpalma 


To further investigate the issue of the precision of era5 discussed in https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/1629#note_151324, I would like to reproduce a ""scientific"" data analysis workflow.

Can you confirm here what variables/frequencies we'll need?

Would the following be enough?

ECMWF S5 CDS, 1 start month (11?), all hindcast and forecasts years, prlr and tas monthly + associated dates of era5.

The idea would be to reproduce what you already have but with the precision in double and compare the final results.

GCB2021 land and ocean fluxes,"Hi @pabretonniere @msamso 

For the 4C project we need the co2 fluxes from the GCB2021 land model runs.

Here are the details:

```

The location of the files is : /output/$MODEL/$EXPERIMENT/$MODEL_$EXPERIMENT_$VAR.nc

I need data from all models, experiments S0/S1/S2, but only the following variables: nbb/fLuc

Can you please download them keeping the directory structure into /esarchive/recon/gcp/gcb2021/original_files/land ?

I put the ocean models and data-based products here /esarchive/recon/gcp/gcb2021/original_files/ocean

gcb_load_A_2021_models.nc - historical model simulations

```

Here is a description of the land experiments:

```
S0: Control. No forcing change (time-invariant “pre-industrial” CO2, climate and land use mask). S0 is needed to diagnose any “cold start” issues or model drift
S1: CO2 only (time-invariant “pre-industrial” climate and land use mask)
S2: CO2 and climate only (time-invariant “pre-industrial” land use mask)
S3: CO2, climate and land use (all forcing time-varying)

Sentinel-2 new data request,"Hi @msamso @pabretonniere 

Like in issue #1238, we need Sentinel-2 data to increase the temporal coverage of the current dataset. Last time, 3 years were requested, later reduced to only 3 weeks. I think 1 year it's more than enough (I am not sure of how much data is 1 year taking into account the spatial and cloud cover filter).

Regarding the spatial coverage, we only need images from the Iberian Peninsula right now.

About the cloud cover, it seems that we can relax a little bit the threshold. I am not sure of what is the appropriate one, but could we say 15% @cgome1 ?

CMORization of LENS and DPLE from CESM1-1-CAM5-CMIP5,"Hi @pabretonniere 

Could the `tos`, `tas` and `pr` files under `/esarchive/exp/ncar/lens/monthly_mean` be saved in cmor format under `/esarchive/exp/CMIP6`? The scenario for times over 2005 come from RCP45 i.e. CMIP5. If it is better to store the cmorized files under `/esarchive/exp/CMIP5` for me it is okay. 

Also, should data from the historical period be separated in a different experiment than the scenario years? From my side I don't need this separation as ESMValTool will have to concatenate them back afterwards. But I don't know what would be more correct in terms of format.

I've spotted that not all dple hindcasts are cmorized yet. Could it be done for the three variables under `/esarchive/exp/ncar/cesm-dple/monthly_mean` and store them at `/esarchive/exp/CMIP6/dcppA-hindcast/CESM1-1-CAM5-CMIP5`?

Now, to make it more optimal I don't think we should download all the orog files for all members and experiments of each dataset, as the orog file for `historical-r1i1p1f1` should be the same as the one for `ssp126-r2i1p1f2` (for example), correct me if I'm wrong @pabretonniere. Therefore with only one orog file per dataset we should be fine. Is there a way of loading the same orog file for different members in ESMValTool @sloosvel ? Do you think what I'm proposing is reasonable?

@msamso I've found many orog files at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/. Nevertheless, maybe it's best if we first discuss which minimum amount of orog files we should download.

Make ORAS5 and ORAS4 ESMValTool-compatible,"Hi @pabretonniere, @msamso,


I think it could be interesting to have `ORAS5` and `ORAS4` (`nemovar_system4`) readable by ESMValTool, at least for some commonly used variables, such as `tos`, `thetao`, `sos`, `so`, maybe `sic`? 

What do you think @aorihuel @portega @rfernand @eexarchou ? 
I don't want to ask extra work if it's only for me. 

The thing is that, for `ORAS4`, these folders already exist:
- `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/nemovar_system4/monthly_mean/tos`: various netcdf files, created by different people. 
- `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/nemovar_system4/monthly_mean/thetao`: I can't read most of them, I got a permission denied :D  I have troubles to visualize the last two produced with ncview.
- `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/nemovar_system4/monthly_mean/so`: I can't open the files. 
- `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/nemovar_system4/monthly_mean/sos`: almost what we need but only for one member? And other various files?

Some of these files seem to be almost what we need, right? Actually, maybe it has already been done for ORAS4? @aorihuel ?

For `ORAS5`, it seems actually easier to produce these cmor-compliant files as we can create new folder with the cmor name of the variables.

ERA5 monthly surface wind stress,"Hi @pabretonniere and @msamso ,

I am looking at the monthly mean of the surface wind stress from ERA5 here:
- `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/tauuo_f6h`
- `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/tauuo_f1h-r1440x721cds`

from a previous discussion with @pabretonniere I understood that differences between those 2 variables would mainly comes from the fact that `tauuo_f1h-r1440x721cds` has been regridded by ECMWF. However, comparing the 2 variables from the same month, I can see large differences that I would not expect from a simple regridding. See for example these figures showing for 1995/01 `tauuo_6h` on the left and `tauuo_f1h-r1440x721cds` on the right:

![Screenshot_from_2022-04-01_10-49-38](/uploads/86b33fba8c6016b1de43ebe25d366181/Screenshot_from_2022-04-01_10-49-38.png)

For example, values are way stronger over East Russia in `tauuo_f1h-r1440x721cds` and way weaker over the extratropical North Atlantic.

Could you re-download those variables to check whether these differences still exist?

Automated ESMValTool recipe filler for periodic homogeneity checks,"With @msamso and @pabretonniere we have suffered some recurrent issues with changes in CMIP6 datasets' metadata that lead to crashed ESMValTool recipe runs. From a fruitful discussion with @fdoblasreyes and @rmarcos, we concluded that it would be useful to launch an automated ESMVal checker once or twice a month. The goal would be to have more control over changes in the metadata that might lead to crashed ESMVal recipes due to data inhomogeneity. 

I've started working on an automated recipe filler that would find all the available historical-scenario dataset concatenations and put them in a recipe. From there it would be a matter of having a job that runs the recipe filler + its corresponding ESMValTool run.

For the moment the script is at `/esarchive/scratch/jcos/esmvaltool/scripts/utils/esarchive_checker_recipe_filler.py` and it has a couple of TODOs:
* Find all available variables (For now the variables must be specified at `/esarchive/scratch/jcos/recipe_filler/recipe_filler_setup.yml`)
* Find all the available historical-scenario experiments available (it is also specified in the setup file)

Other than that, it is already working and ready to do the first tests. How would you like to proceed from here? Do you have any suggestions to add to the script? Should we work on the script in a repo?

Also, I'm not experienced in scheduling jobs to run every so often, so I could use a bit of help with that.

Cheers

I believe both lsm are correct in terms of values, they just reflect different information that are both useful but depend of the needs. However, I think it would make sense to name them differently and make them both having the same value over 100% land points (i.e. either 1 or 0).

This has now been solved with the checker and I'm guessing the recipe won't break anymore. Nevertheless, is there a mechanism to notify such changes and prevent us from sending super heavy jobs that are likely to fail?

error when cdo mergetime EC-Earth3 data in esarchive,"hello @msamso,

how are you?

I am re-preparing some data that I used to use about 2 months ago.

You can find the data here: `/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32507/projects/constrain/data/historical/pr/issue ` (pr_day_EC-Earth3_historical_r20i1p1f1_gr_*.nc).

ERA5 r1440x721 monthly SIC,"Hi @msamso ,


Would it be possible to download the monthly `sic` from ERA5 at the r1440x721 resolution for the year 2009 to 2015 please?

Note also that the already downloaded data in `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/sic_f1h-r1440x721cds/` seem to have been processed in a different way for the data after 200312: they are heavier and looking at the history metadata, there are some differences in the command lines (NCO version, -O option and -copy (not with the - ) for the first command of CDO).

I don't think it impacts the results but for storage issues, we may want to apply the first post-processing to the new data, which saves lighter netcdf.

`/esarchive/scratch/emchamarro/entra/stream/mpi-m/ER-1950_ocean3D_19800101_19801231.nc`

The file contains the 3D ocean variables `so thetao uo vo` at monthly resolution over a year.

As soon as they provide more data (2D ocean and atmosphere) I'll update this.

GPCC data in several folders and versions,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere,

We have realised that there are GPCC data in both `/esarchive/obs/dwd/` and `/esarchive/obs/noaa/` folders. The DWD is the institution that generates this dataset (although it is also available on the NOAA webpage). Thus, we think all the GPCC data could be moved/merged to the DWD folder (maybe keeping symbolic links in case someone is using NOAA folder?).

Also, GPCC has different versions, and they cover different periods:

- first guess: 2014/01 - present (https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/GPCC/html/gpcc_firstguess_doi_download.html)

- v7: 1901/01 - 2013/12 (https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/GPCC/html/fulldata_v7_doi_download.html)

Google Dynamic World dataset,"'@cgome1 made me aware of [this](https://sites.google.com/view/dynamic-world/home) awesome land cover dataset by Google, based on S2 imagery.

We would like to have it downloaded to integrate it into the WWTP image characterization dataset, based also on S2 data.

The main issue is that it seems that the dataset is only available in Google Earth Engine.

I got started with the [example script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=Examples:Datasets/GOOGLE_DYNAMICWORLD_V1) and I could visualize images for our region and period of interest (Iberian Peninsula, 13-31 July 2020).

For the download, it seems that Google provides few options (Cloud Storage or Google Drive). And it's only ready to Export single images.

Then I tried [this library](https://github.com/fitoprincipe/geetools-code-editor) for batch downloading, adapting the example script to not generate a single image, but instead map the set operations to an image collection.

This is the result:

dcppA-hindcast tos IPSL-CM6A-LR has latitude values over 90º,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere ,

The grid for the `tos` dcppA-hindcast outputs of IPSL-CM6A-LR in the form `gr` has values of latitude over 90º (lat=90.00062). It is not an issue for calculations, I think. But of course ESMVal complains about it. What could we do about it? Would slightly changing do the trick or should the dataset be redownloaded? 

If the redownload has the same issue, then it would be nice to notify the institution in charge. 

Thanks!

areacello file name and DCPP data,"Hi @sloosvel ,

I'm trying to compute density regional averages for multiple CMIP6 models for the DCPP runs.
It worked fine for the historical data of those same models, even though I was ""redirecting"" ESMVal to work with areacello for the piControl runs. What I think is happening is that the areacello file does not match the file-name ESMVal-Tool looks for when running it for DCPP data (because of the startdate, there is a hyphen, not an underscore). I tried to make the file name definition more generic but I'm not changing it in the right place, apparently. Could you please tell me what I'm doing wrong?

These functionalities are available in this package:
- Decode encoded patient age to any time unit (years, months, etc)
- Convert .dbc files to DBF databases or read them into pandas dataframes. DBC files are basically DBFs compressed by a proprietary algorithm.
- Read SINAN dbf files returning DataFrames with properly typed columns

I would like to have the data aggregated in one file per disease.

I can download it using FileZilla but I have to do one-by-one (for each year) and I can't pre-process the data using the package as I don't know Python. 

To see the data in FileZilla:
""For SINAN, there is a FTP link to download the data without identification. To download them, in the Host, fill in the link Ftp.datasus.gov.br and accept it as secure. Fill in Remote site: /dissemin/publicos/SINAN/. Select ""DADOS"". For some diseases, there are options as preliminary (PRELIM) and final data (FINAIS), for others, just one of them.

I am not sure if an update of current data available in esarchive is enough.

Thank you very much,

ERA5 rsds units issue,"Hi @msamso 

There seems to be a jump in the units from the ERA5 monthly_mean rsds variable. The units in the metadata are said to be W*m⁻2*s but the order of magnitude between years prior to 1979 and years from 1979 changes by about 10⁵. Is this a formatting issue? I see the issue on the downloads is quite recent so maybe the files are just not ready yet (https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/requests/-/issues/1779)

My request is similar to the previous ones:
From the esgf data node (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/) I would need ""uo"" and ""vo"" data with the following search criteria:
#historical #r1i1p1f1 #mon 
Note that this time we are asking for all model grids, not only gn.
Since these data are 3D and hence quite big, we would like to limit the request to the period 1950-2014 instead of 1850-2014.
Thanks a lot for your collaboration.

I need the data for the `spinup-1950` and  `control-1950` experiments. For the following MIPs and variables:
- Omon
  - so
- Oday
  - mlotst
  - sos

- model: EC-Earth3P

if the daily frequency is not available I could manage with monthly frequency.
 
Data would need to be downloaded from JASMIN or the ESGF nodes. Data may be here
- `spinup-1950`: `/gws/nopw/j04/primavera4/upload/EC-Earth-Consortium/EC-Earth-3-LR/incoming/spinup-bsc`
- `control-1950`: on tape. 2013+: `/gws/nopw/j04/primavera1/WP6/stream2/control/HighResMIP/EC-Earth-Consortium/`

Thank you!

compute hurs system5c3s daily_mean,"Hi @msamso and @pabretonniere 

I need to compare variable hurs daily_mean from system5c3s with hurs daily_mean era5. Could you compute hurs from `/esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily_mean/tas_f6h` and `/esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system5c3s/daily_mean/tdps_f6h` in the same way that `/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/daily_mean/hurs_f1h-r1440x721cds` was calculated? (I need it at least for the period 1993-2016).

ERA5 data floats vs double in esarchive,"Hi @pabretonniere @msamso 

This is just to inform about an issue I found with ERA5 data in esarchive that makes ESMValTool crash. It has to be with data being double rather than floats.

So when I ran `/esarchive/scratch/emchamarro/es-esmvaltool/recipes/recipe_tos-bias_a1ts.yml` and it failed because:

`
/esarchive/scratch/emchamarro/es-esmvaltool/output/recipe_tos-bias_a1ts_20221123_164317/run/tas/latlon/log.txt
`

```
fatal:Assignment type mismatch, right hand side can't be coerced to type of left hand side
```

I found in Google it could be because of the data being double, so I created a test folder 

`/esarchive/recon/ecmwf/era5/monthly_mean/tos_f1h-r1440x721cds_floats/`

and used cdo to make it floats, with `cdo -b f32 copy`. When calling these new data, the script runs OK.

Perhaps this issue can affect other datasets; I have not checked and didn't copy all the data into the new test folder. Could you please check and make the necessary arrangements? Let me know if I can help. Thanks very much

Download ECMWF SEAS5.1 hindcast from the CDS,"Hi @msamso,

The CDS have discontinued **SEAS5** and are currently working on uploading the hindcast data for **the new version of ECMWF SEAS, 5.1**. As of right now, the startdates for October, November and December are available through the CDS API. They will be adding the rest progressively in calendar order. 
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/seasonal-original-single-levels

Here is a summary of what we need:

- Time period: 1981-2016
- Frequency: subdaily, then aggregated to daily and monthly
- Path: /esarchive/exp/ecmwf/system51c3s/
- Source: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/seasonal-original-single-levels,
- Which variables: tas, prlr, rsds, tasmin, tasmax, psl, uas, vas, tdp`
- Which months: All available months, starting from December (highest priority)

Here are the scripts we used operationally to download and post-process the old SEAS5 data, in case they are useful:
- CDS API requests: https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/es/S2S4E-backend-BSC/-/tree/master/download-formatting/SEAS5/req
